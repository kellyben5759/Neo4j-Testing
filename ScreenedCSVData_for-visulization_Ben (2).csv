380,Karbasi M;Shokoohi A;Saghafian B,Loss of life estimation due to flash floods in residential areas using a regional model,WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,"Flood is a severe natural disaster which causes major damages in most regions including in iran. Loss of human lives as a consequence of flash flood has not been sufficiently studied despite its high annual rate. Review of related literature indicates relatively low accuracy of available global relationships for estimating loss of life due to flash floods. As a result, regional equations dealing with loss of life estimation relying on all effective hydraulic and evacuation variables is a way forward. In this study, hydraulic variables, such as depth, velocity and rise rate, and evacuation parameters, including available time for evacuation and fraction of people evacuated, were adopted to develop a regional loss of life equation in residential areas of kan watershed case study, tehran, iran, using a calibrated 2dhec-ras model. Different number of fatalities in downstream and upstream villages revealed the importance of evacuation time when an early flood warning system is operational. Comparison of the proposed regional equation with available global equations showed that the proposed equation provides more accurate estimation of the number of fatalities in the study area. Regarding the estimated mortality, a local sensitivity analysis performed on the developed equation showed the importance of flood depth to evacuation time ratio, water rising rate and flow velocity, respectively.",LOSS OF LIFE; FLASH FLOOD; REGIONAL MODEL; EVACUATION; FLOOD WARNING; KAN WATERSHED,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"BOYD E, 2005, 4 UCLA C PUBL HLTH D.;BRAZDOVA M, 2014, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V14, P1663, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-14-1663-2014.;BRUNNER G.W., 2016, HEC RAS RIVER ANAL S.;DE BRUIJN KM, 2015, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V15, P1297, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-15-1297-2015.;DI MAURO M, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V63, P1083, DOI 10.1007/S11069-012-0207-4.;DUISER J.

It generates high negative impacts of various kinds: social, environmental and economic. These problems grow exponentially in megacities, since the disorderly occupation of land, coupled with the size of the population, make it extremely complex to control and to manage. Structural measures for flood control are not enough, the city needs to deploy a number of non-structural measures such as a flood warning system. This system aims to provide real-time occurrence and forecast of floods that may cause impacts in several areas of the city. These forecasts trigger a series of actions for civil defense, firefighter, traffic control, social support and other entities. The flood warning system of the sao paulo metropolitan region, brazil, called saisp system, installed a set of weather radars and telemetry networks, as well as a decision support system (ssd) operated by engineers and meteorologists, which generates a set of forecasting bulletins 24 hours a day during all year long. Several public organizations and press receive these bulletins in real time and a set of actions can be managed in order to minimize the impacts of critical hydrological events. This paper presents some analysis of a flash flood event observed in the jaguar river small catchment on february 6th, 2016 (80 mm in one hour). In this day a set of social works could be done due to saisp information. Therefore with this event was possible to evaluate a set of social benefits that this type of system back to town. In general is very difficult to assess the social benefits that this type of system produces in a big city, so the information obtained in this event can subsidize the planning of new systems, as overall social benefits are difficult to measure in economic values, because most of them are intangible.",,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,"BOWLER NE, 2006, Q J ROY METEOR SOC, V132, P2127, DOI 10.1256/QJ.04.100.;CANIL K., 2006, THESIS.;DOUGLAS IAN, 1983, URBAN ENV.;FREITAS E.

458,Wadhawan Sk,"Landslide susceptibility mapping, vulnerability and risk assessment for development of early warning systems in india","LANDSLIDES: THEORY, PRACTICE AND MODELLING","Landslide or the landmass movement is a geomorphic hill slope physical process of mass-wasting resulting in downslope rolling of large mass of debris, regolith and soil under influence of gravity. It is caused by a combination of particular geo-factors that are region or territory specific. Landslides are generally triggered and activated by substantial precipitation and/or earthquake tremors and other anthropogenic interventions such as over the top cutting of slant for development of mountainous roads/streets and other excavations for civil structures, etc. The relatively young entire himalayan hilly tract, mountainous steep slopes in sub-himalayan landscape of north-east india, western ghats, the nilgiris in tamil nadu and konkan ranges are susceptible to landslides or debris flow. In order to formulate strategies to minimize societal impacts of landslides, a systematic approach would entail preparation of landslide susceptibility maps linked to landslide incidence inventory and making them available to the concerned stakeholders for necessary preparatory and mitigation measures. Geological survey of india (gsi) being the nodal agency for landslides studies in india formally launched on february 05, 2014 the national landslide susceptibility mapping (nlsm) programme which has been a geoscientific exercise on 1: 50,000 scale on gis platform in making both quantitative or qualitative estimates of spatial distribution of landslides which either exists or has the potential to occur in a given area. Gsi has formulated a set of standard operating procedures that emphasize on geo-parametric data collection (as per standard and devised formats) for landslide inventory. These data sets are synthesized with relevant spatially-distributed causative thematic maps into susceptibility zonation which represents geospatial information indicating intensity and propensity of landslides. Such baseline data will ultimately lead to the collation and evaluation of landslide hazard and risk and mitigation plans. It will also help in disaster preparedness of the country and to indicate areas critical for landslide monitoring and developing early warning system (ews). It is aimed to demarcate and facilitate prioritization of areas for further detailed studies (meso- and micro-scales) and help in regional land use planning and provide the scientific basis for framing the land use zoning regulations. Several lessons were learnt from uttarakhand disaster of june 2013 in india that compelled re-evaluation of the existing methodology of conducting geosurveys of macro scale landslide susceptibility maps. Additional geofactors that also need to be considered include: effect of toe erosion by higher order streams, effect of long runouts of the debris flows and drainage morphometry, nature and size of clastic components, etc. It is intended to elaborate here a synthesis of various approaches and constraints on continuing research on such country-wide programmes on landslides related geohazards characterization and its implications on evolving ews for the societal preparedness and resilience for mitigating impending disasters. However, any method of predicting landslide susceptibility needs validation which sometimes may be difficult in areas having no land sliding history. Besides, ews need also to highlight mitigation efforts/remedial measures through geotechnical and engineering solutions as suited to indian conditions on case to case basis, delineation of safe escape routes in the event of a landslide/debris flow/flash floods, and for optimum utilization of available resources.",,RAINFALL THRESHOLDS; AREA NORTH; HAZARD; HIMALAYAS; MAPS,ENGLISH,"ARTICLE, BOOK CHAPTER",INCOLLECTION,0,none,"WADHAWAN, SK (REPRINT AUTHOR), GEOL SURVEY INDIA, JAIPUR, RAJASTHAN, INDIA.;WADHAWAN, SUDESH KUMAR, GEOL SURVEY INDIA, JAIPUR, RAJASTHAN, INDIA.",10.1007/978-3-319-77377-3\_8,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","PRADHAN, SP AND VISHAL, V AND SINGH, TN",,"978-3-319-77377-3, 978-3-319-77376-6",1878-9897,,145-172,SPRINGER,50,2019,ISI000466559900010,63,"GEOCHEMISTRY \& GEOPHYSICS, ENGINEERING, GEOLOGY",1,"GEOCHEMISTRY \& GEOPHYSICS, ENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL, GEOLOGY",,ADVANCES IN NATURAL AND TECHNOLOGICAL HAZARDS RESEARCH,BM6GY,"LANDSLIDES: THEORY, PRACTICE AND MODELLING","WADHAWAN, SK (REPRINT AUTHOR), GEOL SURVEY INDIA, JAIPUR, RAJASTHAN, INDIA",ISI,,NOTREPORTED,,"WADHAWAN SK, 2019, LANDSLIDES: THEORY, PRACTICE AND MODELLING","WADHAWAN SK, 2019, LANDSLIDES: THEORY, PRACTICE AND MODELLING",TRUE,0,0,2,2,0,0,3,0,5

Other variables come into play, including those related to the nature of the hazard, in this case flash floods, and those related to socio-economic and land use variables, and all of these might be influenced by political decision-making. These data can be incorporated as separate data layers in a geographic information system, thus facilitating analysis of spatial patterns as well as providing the basis for determining measures of vulnerability, a number of methods have been developed. These methods take into account probability of occurrence, indices of the spatial extent, and characteristics of the community at risk. Community is sometimes defined by spatial boundaries and other times by characteristics such as age or mobility, and the proportion or absolute number of people and amount of property at risk.

Magnitude recurrence relations were tentatively established for the two main slope processes: landslides on the hill slopes, and large debris flows extending out from the gully systems on to the plains. From the recurrence relations, landslide hazard (h) was estimated as the annual probability of a point being impacted by a landslide. The nature, number (e) and geographic distribution of the elements at risk were obtained by interrogating the gis, and their vulnerabilities (v) to destruction by the two main landslide slope processes were assessed. From this information, specific risk (= h x v) and total risk (= h x v x e) maps were produced. Although total landslide risk is relatively low at present, it will increase as development extends further into the hill slopes, unless adequate mitigation measures are taken. Large debris flows, while considerably less frequent than landslides on cut slopes, could impact on subdivisions at the base of the slopes. Blockage by landslides of roads and railways providing access to cairns can cause isolation of the community.

107,Lian J;Yang W;Xu K;Ma C,Flash flood vulnerability assessment for small catchments with a material flow approach,NATURAL HAZARDS,"Flash flood often causes serious losses in small catchments of china. Nevertheless, the flash flood vulnerability assessment is relatively limited in china. This paper presented a material flow assessment framework to evaluate the flash flood vulnerability for small catchments in wuzhishan county of hainan province, china. The framework was developed into three parts: selection of typical villages and small catchments, calculation of exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity with material flow analysis, and multiple evaluation of vulnerability with the proposed material flow indices. In this framework, all material flows of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity were measured by water's mass. Then, the relationship between the three elements of vulnerability was established through material flow indices. Results of the three elements of vulnerability and four material flow indices in each small catchment were exhibited via gis. The evaluation results suggested that catchments with lower exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity did not necessarily lead to lower vulnerability, as the inherent relationship among them might aggravate the vulnerability of catchments to flash flood. Some suggestions were put forward for the prevention of flash flood based on the vulnerability assessment.

134,Ballesteros C;Jimenez Ja;Viavattene C,A multi-component flood risk assessment in the maresme coast (nw mediterranean),NATURAL HAZARDS,"Coastal regions are the areas most threatened by natural hazards, with floods being the most frequent and significant threat in terms of their induced impacts, and therefore, any management scheme requires their evaluation. In coastal areas, flooding is a hazard associated with various processes acting at different scales: coastal storms, flash floods, and sea level rise (slr). In order to address the problem as a whole, this study presents a methodology to undertake a preliminary integrated risk assessment that determines the magnitude of the different flood processes (flash flood, marine storm, slr) and their associated consequences, taking into account their temporal and spatial scales. The risk is quantified using specific indicators to assess the magnitude of the hazard (for each component) and the consequences in a common scale. This allows for a robust comparison of the spatial risk distribution along the coast in order to identify both the areas at greatest risk and the risk components that have the greatest impact. This methodology is applied on the maresme coast (nw mediterranean, spain), which can be considered representative of developed areas of the spanish mediterranean coast. The results obtained characterise this coastline as an area of relatively low overall risk, although some hot spots have been identified with high-risk values, with flash flooding being the principal risk process.",FLOOD; STORMS; FLASH FLOODS; SLR; RISK; INDICATORS; SPRC,SEA-LEVEL RISE; FLASH FLOODS; VULNERABILITY INDEX; NATURAL HAZARDS; CATALAN BEACHES; REGIONAL-SCALE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; STORM XYNTHIA; SCENARIOS; DAMAGE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,5,"ALVARADO-AGUILAR D, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V62, P1301, DOI 10.1007/S11069-012-0149-X.;[ANONYMOUS], 2016, INSURANCE COMPENSATI.;[ANONYMOUS], 2015, GEN CAT.;ANSELME B, 2011, CR GEOSCI, V343, P677, DOI 10.1016/J.CRTE.2011.07.006.;ARMAROLI C, 2012, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V143, P34, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2011.09.006.;BALICA SF, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V64, P73, DOI 10.1007/S11069-012-0234-1.;BARNOLAS M, 2007, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V7, P271, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-7-271-2007.;BARREDO JI, 2007, NAT HAZARDS, V42, P125, DOI 10.1007/S11069-006-9065-2.;BENAVENTE J, 2006, CONT SHELF RES, V26, P1061, DOI 10.1016/J.CSR.2005.12.015.;BIRKMANN J., 2007, ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS, V7, P20, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVHAZ.2007.04.002.;BONDESAN M, 1995, J COASTAL RES, V11, P1354.;BOSOM E, 2011, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V11, P475, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-11-475-2011.;BROXTON PD, 2014, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V53, P1996, DOI 10.1175/JAMC-D-13-0356.1.;BRYAN B, 2001, ENVIRON MODEL ASSESS, V6, P57, DOI 10.1023/A:1011515213106.;BELMONTE AMC, 2011, APPL GEOGR, V31, P136, DOI 10.1016/J.APGEOG.2010.03.003.;CAMARASA-BELMONTE AM, 2012, LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN, V104, P189, DOI 10.1016/J.LANDURBPLAN.2011.10.009.;CEA, 2007, RED SOC EC IMP CLIM.;CERU J, 2012, 2012 ESRI FED GIS C.;CREACH A, 2015, NAT HAZARDS, V77, P1679, DOI 10.1007/S11069-015-1669-Y.;DAWSON RJ, 2009, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V95, P249, DOI 10.1007/S10584-008-9532-8.;DE MOEL H, 2015, MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL, V20, P865, DOI 10.1007/S11027-015-9654-Z.;DE PIPPO T, 2008, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V97, P451, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2007.08.015.;EEA, 2006, 6 EEA, V107.;EEA 2013.

Therefore, efforts to reduce flash flood-related losses have primarily focused on the compilation of emergency operation plans (eops). Conversely, there have been only a few attempts to provide cartographic representations of eops in order to show the spatial context of crisis operations. In the present map and its commentary, we describe a pilot study of flash flood household labelling for use in emergency operations carried out in chrastava town, northern czechia. Analyses of existing geographical databases, together with detailed field surveys, have been performed to map relevant characteristics of 1110 buildings in terms of their location, function, number of residents and degree of flood hazard, as well as the presence of flood-protection measures. The map sheet is composed of the main map (overview of flood extent and impacts) and three supplementary maps (technical and social vulnerability of buildings), and the map key is designed to facilitate strategic planning and directing of emergency operations in the study area.",FLOOD; LABELLING; HOUSEHOLD; EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT; CZECHIA,RESILIENCE; HAZARDS; RISK; VULNERABILITY; BUILDINGS; MODEL,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"ADGER WN, 2000, PROG HUM GEOG, V24, P347, DOI 10.1191/030913200701540465.;ALEXANDER D, 2005, DISASTER PREV MANAG, V14, P158, DOI DOI 10.1108/09653560510595164.;ALEXANDER D.

234,Ballesteros C;Jimenez Ja;Viavattene C,Flood risk evaluation to multiple components on the coast of maresme,RIBAGUA-REVISTA IBEROAMERICANA DEL AGUA,"The coast is one of the areas most affected by natural hazards, with floods being the most frequent and significant of these in terms of their induced impacts, so any management scheme requires their evaluation. In coastal areas, flooding is a hazard associated with different processes acting at different scales: coastal storms, flash floods and sea level rise (slr). To address the problem as a whole, this study presents a methodology to undertake a preliminary integrated risk assessment of the magnitude of each flood component, taking into account their scope (extension of the affected area) and their temporal scale. The risk is quantified using specific indicators to assess the hazard magnitude (for each component) and the consequences. This allows for a robust comparison of the spatial risk distribution along the coast in order to identify both the most at-risk areas and the most influential risk components. This methodology is applied to a stretch of coastline (maresme, catalonia) representative of the spanish mediterranean coast. The results obtained characterise this coastline as an area with a relatively low overall risk, although some hotspots are identified as having high-risk values.",FLOOD; STORMS; FLASH FLOODS; SEA LEVEL; RISK; INDICATORS,SEA-LEVEL RISE; CATALAN COAST; FLASH FLOODS; MANAGEMENT; CATALONIA; SCENARIOS; EUROPE; SPAIN,SPANISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"ACA, 2015, AG CAT AIG.;BARNOLAS M, 2007, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V7, P271, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-7-271-2007.;BOSOM E, 2014, THESIS.;BRENNER J, 2006, ENVIRON MANAGE, V38, P993, DOI 10.1007/S00267-005-0210-6.;BROXTON PD, 2014, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V53, P1996, DOI 10.1175/JAMC-D-13-0356.1.;BRUUN P, 1962, J WATERWAYS HARBORS, V88, P117, DOI DOI 10.2112/SI65-356.1.;CERU J., 2012, ESRI FED GIS C.;EEA, 2013, BAL FUT 2ROP COASTS.;EEA, 2006, CHANG FAC EUR COAST.;FLETA J., 2006, FLOODING AREAS RISK, VII, P458.;GALLIEN TW, 2011, COAST ENG, V58, P567, DOI 10.1016/J.COASTALENG.2011.01.011.;GAUME E, 2009, J HYDROL, V367, P70, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2008.12.028.;GOULDBY B, 2005, LANGUAGE RISK PROJEC.;GREEN C., 2011, DELIVERABLE 6 1.;GUEDES SOARES C., 2002, P 21 INT C OFFSH MEC, P669.;HINKEL J, 2015, NAT CLIM CHANGE, V5, P188, DOI 10.1038/NCLIMATE2505.;HOLDGATE M.

Classically-named muddy floods in such areas, these events are significant as they cause important damage on buildings and infrastructures and can cause loss of life. Few studies have focused on these hazards because they affect small-size basins, without highly urbanised areas, and rarely occur in the same areas. Preventive maps based on the main morphometrics characteristics detected on 189 affected basins over the period 1983-2005 and on the spatial distribution of built terrain were determined from the regional to local scales.

94,Changnon Sa;Kunkel Ke;Andsager K,Causes for record high flood losses in the central united states,WATER INTERNATIONAL,"Flood losses in the north central united states are the nation's highest since 1980. Losses in iowa rank first nationally and those in two adjacent states rank fourth (missouri) and sixth (illinois). Explanations were sought for this three-state regional maximum of flood losses, including geophysical, societal, and climatological conditions. Comparisons of conditions with those of surrounding areas revealed the three states had more land exposure to the major flood-prone rivers (mississippi, missouri, and ohio) than any other state or group of states. The region also has a higher population density than surrounding areas and contains three of the five largest metropolitan areas of the midwest. Farm land values rank just behind those of the three states to the immediate west. Further, the region is the center of the nation's complex surface and riverine transportation systems that are highly vulnerable to flooding. The assessment of regional hydroclimatic factors on enhanced flooding in the three-state region was based on a case study of historic floods on two adjacent basins located near the center of the region. Historic flood data showed systematic, long-term increases in both flood incidence and magnitude. Certain precipitation conditions on the basins also showed systematic temporal increases since the 1920s, including annual precipitation, number of seven-day heavy rain events, and the number of days with precipitation. This climatic shift to more multi-day periods of heavy rain appears to be the major reason that hydrologic flooding in the three states has increased since the 1920s. Analysis of the individual major hydrologic floods revealed five different types of precipitation conditions, including snowmelt situations that produced major floods. The primary cause of major floods was prolonged periods of four- to 13-day durations with intermittent moderate to heavy rains, and these events often included heavy, 15-centimeter rainstorms capable of producing flash floods. Climatic data reveal that the three states experience more heavy rain-producing synoptic weather conditions, cyclonic activity, and intense rainfalls than do most surrounding states. Collectively, these geophysical, hydroclimatic, and societal factors combine to cause the high flood losses in the nation's central region.",FLOODS; FLOOD LOSSES; CLIMATE CHANGE; HEAVY RAINFALL; US MIDWEST,MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE COMPLEXES; PRECIPITATION; FREQUENCY; INTENSITY; CYCLONES; TRENDS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,15,"ANGEL JR, 1998, J CLIMATE, V11, P61, DOI 10.1175/1520-0442(1998)011<0061:TFAIOG>2.0.CO,2.;[ANONYMOUS], 1999, WORLD ALMANAC BOOK F.;BHOWMIK N, 1996, GREAT FLOOD 1993, P101.;BRUNKOW D.

That is due to several factors including its rugged topography and geological structures. Hence, precise assessment of floods becomes a more vital demand in development planning. A gis-based methodology has been developed for quantifying and spatially mapping the flood characteristics. The core of this new approach is integrating several topographic, metrological, geological, and land use data sets in a geographic information system (gis) environment that utilizes the curve number method of flood modelling for ungauged arid catchments. Based on the estimated flood volume of sub-basins, a hazard factor has been developed to quantify the expected hazard level for each road. Applying this proposed approach reveals that 21 \% of the road network in makkah city is subjected to low flood hazards, 29 \% is facing medium hazards, and 50 \% of roads are exposed to harsh flood impacts. The developed approach may be considered a digital precise method that can be easily re-run, in other situations or regions, to estimate flood hazards on roads.",FLOOD ASSESSMENT; RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODEL; ROAD NETWORK; GIS; SAUDI ARABIA,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,20,"AL SAUD MASHAEL, 2010, JOURNAL OF WATER RESOURCE AND PROTECTION, V2, P839, DOI 10.4236/JWARP.2010.29099.;AZAB M.

The appearance of these phenomena, along with the expansion of human settlements in the proximity of the river network, determines the growth of the risk, each year. In the hydrographic basin of the ozana river, the settlements are located exclusively on the valley of the river and its' main tributaries, and their territorial extent frequently overlaps the floodplain. The current study emphasizes the identification of the land use categories, inside the built-up area of each village along the ozana river valley, and their classification, according to economic losses that can be generated during a flash flood. Also, the 0.1\% occurrence flood extent has been integrated into the analysis.

217,Liu C;Li Y,Measuring eco-roof mitigation on flash floods via gis simulation,BUILT ENVIRONMENT PROJECT AND ASSET MANAGEMENT,"Purpose - the rapid and ongoing expansion of urbanised impervious areas could lead to more frequent flood inundation in urban flood-prone regions. Nowadays, urban flood inundation induced by rainstorm is an expensive natural disaster in many countries. In order to reduce the flooding risk, eco-roof systems (or green roof systems) could be considered as an effective mechanism of mitigating flooding disasters through their rainwater retention capability. However, there is still a lack of examining the stormwater management tool. The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the effects on flooding disaster from extensive green roofs. Design/methodology/approach - based on geographical information system (gis) simulation, this research presents a frame of assessing eco-roof impacts on urban flash floods. The approach addresses both urban rainfall-runoff and underground hydrologic models for traditional impervious and green roofs. Deakin university's geelong waurn ponds campus is chosen as a study case. Gis technologies are then utilised to visualise and analyse the effects on flood inundation from surface properties of building roofs. Findings - the results reveal that the eco-roof systems generate varying degrees of mitigation of urban flood inundation with different return period storms. Originality/value - although the eco-roof technology is considered as an effective stormwater management tool, it is not commonly adopted and examined in urban floods. This study will bring benefits to urban planners for raising awareness of hazard impacts and to construction technicians for considering disaster mitigation via roof technologies. The approach proposed here could be used for the disaster mitigation in future urban planning.",DISASTER RISK REDUCTION; NUMERICAL SIMULATION; GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEMS (GISS); GREEN BUILDING; INFRASTRUCTURE MANAGEMENT; FLOODS; DISASTER PLANNING; LAND USE; GREEN ROOF; MOUSE; CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE,SCS-CN METHOD; GREEN ROOFS; VEGETATED ROOFS; RUNOFF; PERFORMANCE; INUNDATION; MODEL,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"[ANONYMOUS], 1993, DES CONSTR URB STORM, V77.;BENGTSSON L, 2005, NORD HYDROL, V36, P259.;BOM, 2013, NAT ARR FLOOD FOR WA.;BOM, 2015, DES RAINF.;CARTER T, 2007, LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN, V80, P84, DOI 10.1016/J.LANDURBPLAN.2006.06.005.;CARTER TL, 2006, J AM WATER RESOUR AS, V42, P1261, DOI 10.1111/J.1752-1688.2006.TB05611.X.;CHEN J, 2009, J HYDROL, V373, P184, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2009.04.021.;CHOW V.

249,Zelenakova M;Ganova L;Purcz P;Satrapa L;Horsky M;Harbul'akova Vo,"Flood risk assessment from flash floods in bodva river basin, slovakia",DEPENDABILITY ENGINEERING AND COMPLEX SYSTEMS,"The main objective of flood management as well as the entire management cycle is regulated by directive of the european parliament and of the council 2007/60/ec on the assessment and management of flood risks. The paper deals with an application of preliminary flood risk assessment, particularly flood risk assessment from flash floods in the bodva river basin, which is situated in the south of the slovak republic. The aim of the preliminary assessment of flood risk from flash floods is determining the hazard and the vulnerability of assessed area. The result of identification of a hazard is the determination of critical points in the basin and their contributing surfaces on the basis of the geometric and physiogeographic characteristics of the contributing surfaces. Vulnerability in the study area is determined on the basis of the type and density of the built-up area. The resulting flood risk is stated as a moderate risk.

Present urbanization happening in these cities creates an imbalance between generated urban runoff volume and effective drainage capacity. For the survival of these, it is vital in enhancing the efficiency of an urban drainage system. However, it is a complicated task due to the accumulation of solid waste in drainage channels. These drainage systems are super sensitive to some external factors caused by their immediate surroundings. This study found out the impact of the urban form, population agglomeration, floating population, imminent prone areas of urban sprawl and waste disposing patterns of settlers can be highly influenced to the efficiency of a storm drainage system. Hence, geographical information system based computational techniques and weighted fussy sets are being used to track the attention need areas of the system. These particular zones to be treated through the design of ``smart storm drainage unit. By this, it is expected to maintain a clear drainage channel for transportation of surface runoff all the time. Thus, by smart storm drainage will be fixed into the breakdown areas or highly sensitive areas of a drainage system.

59,Sun R;Wang X;Zhou Z;Ao X;Sun X;Song M,Study of the comprehensive risk analysis of dam-break flooding based on the numerical simulation of flood routing. Part i: model development,NATURAL HAZARDS,"Dam-break floods have been of increasing concern to safety engineers and decision makers. The presence of complex terrain in inundation areas multiplies the simulation difficulty of flood routing. In previous studies, representing the flood routing parameters empirically does not reflect the characteristics of flood routing, which strongly influences the accurate assessment of the dam-break consequences. The basis for carrying out dangerous reservoir reinforcement is just engineering safety, without considering the actual situation of downstream areas. In this study, a comprehensive risk analysis of the dam-break flood was implemented based on the numerical simulation of flood routing. First, coupled with the volume of fluid method, a three-dimensional k-e > turbulence mathematical model was developed for flood routing in complex inundation areas. Then, based on the flow parameters obtained through computational fluid dynamics modeling, the attribute measure methodology was used for the evaluation of consequences combined with the calculation of the dam-break consequences (loss of life, economic loss, social and environmental influence). Furthermore, a methodology containing the combined weight method and the technique for order performance by similarity to ideal solution method was proposed for risk ranking of dangerous reservoirs due to its logical consideration of scalar values that simultaneously account for both the best and worst alternatives. Finally, a sensitivity analysis was performed to provide information about the stability of risk ranking.

Gales and rainstorms brought by typhoon can directly cause serious loss in economy and also induce storm surge, flash flood, mud-rock flow, landslide and other secondary disasters. This article studies the impact of collapsing force of typhoon gale and the risk-based warning of typhoon rainstorm. By calculating the accumulated wind pressure and the designed wind load of bearing walls of low-rise building in coastal region, we define the damaged building index. In addition, four steps for the risk-based warning or impact forecasting for small and medium-sized river basins, flash flood, mud flows and landslides caused by typhoon rainstorm are introduced, which include understanding vulnerability of disaster carriers, developing risk thresholds of disasters, improving the accuracy of qpe/qpf and the risk assessment skill.",COLLAPSING FORCE OF TYPHOON; WIND PRESSURE; DAMAGED BUILDING INDEX; TORRENTIAL RAINFALL; RISK-BASED WARNING,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"CHEN LIANSHOU, 2009, TYPHOON FORECAST ITS, P190.;EMANUEL K A, 1991, ADV MECH, V3, P351.;GUO GUI, 2017, J CATASTROPHOLOGY, V4, P225.;NIU HAIYAN, 2011, J CATASTROPHOLOGY, V3, P206.;WANG WEIGUO, 2016, J I DISASTER PREVENT, V2, P102.;WEI ZHANGJIN, 2012, J CATASTROPHOLOGY, V24, P190.;WEN YU, 2005, DISASTER REDUCTION C, V8, P86.","WEI, L (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHINA METEOROL ADM, NATL METEOROL CTR, 46 ZHONGGUANCUN SOUTH ST, BEIJING 100081, PEOPLES R CHINA.;WEI, LI, LI, JIAYING, YANG, XUAN, CHINA METEOROL ADM, NATL METEOROL CTR, 46 ZHONGGUANCUN SOUTH ST, BEIJING 100081, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.6057/2018TCRR01.04,"ESCAP-WMO TYPHOON COMMITTEE, MACAU, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,2225-6032,1,31-36,ESCAP-WMO TYPHOON COMMITTEE,7,2018,ISI000438309600004,7,METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES,2,METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES,WEILICMA.GOV.CN,,GM6UB,,"WEI, L (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHINA METEOROL ADM, NATL METEOROL CTR, 46 ZHONGGUANCUN SOUTH ST, BEIJING 100081, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,NATL METEOROL CTR,NATL METEOROL CTR,,"WEI L, 2018, TROP CYCLONE RES REV","WEI L, 2018, TROP CYCLONE RES REV",FALSE,1,0,1,0,0,6,4,0,2

In this study a technique is applied for the first time to implement the elements of a settled area in the input data of a 3-dimensional, physically based erosion prediction model. For that purpose a digital elevation model has been modified with the relative height of the settlement structures. Applying this method the damages of an observed inundation event could be modelled in its spatial extends.

429,Ratzinger K;Proske D,Historical stone arch bridges under horizontal debris flow impact,PROCEEDINGS OF THE 6TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON ARCH BRIDGES (ARCH `10),"Many historical arch bridges are situated in mountain regions. Such historical bridges may be exposed to several natural hazards such as flash floods with dead wood and debris flows. For example, in the year 2000 a heavy debris flow destroyed an arch bridge in log pod mangartom, slovenia and only recently, in september 2008 an arch bridge was overflowed by a debris flow. A new launched research project at the university of natural resources and applied life sciences, vienna tries to combine advanced numerical models of debris flows with advanced models of historical masonry arch bridges under horizontal loads. The research project starts with separate finite element modelling of different structural elements of arch bridges such as spandrel walls, the arch itself, roadway slabs, pavements and foundations under single and distributed horizontal loads. Furthermore miniaturized tests are planned to investigate the behaviour of the overall bridge under debris flow impacts. The results will be used to combine the modelling of the different structural elements considering the interaction during a horizontal loading. Furthermore this bridge model will then be combined with debris flow simulation. Also earlier works considering horizontal ship impacts against historical arch bridges will be used control. The paper will present latest research results.",,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,"BAKER MA., 1997, THESIS.;BECKE A., 2005, THESIS TU DRESDEN.;DE TOMMASI G, 2003, ADV ARC SER, V16, P287.;DENG Z., 1997, THESIS.;GOCHT R., 1978, THESIS.;HANNAWALD F, 2003, MESSWERTGESTATZTE BE, V72, P507.;HUBL J., 2003, 50 WLS, V3.;KAITNA R., 2007, P ESREL 2007 STAV.;PROSKE D, 2005, RELIAB ENG SYST SAFE, V90, P261, DOI 10.1016/J.RESS.2004.10.003.;PROSKE D, 2009, SAFETY OF HISTORICAL STONE ARCH BRIDGES, P1, DOI 10.1007/978-3-540-77618-5.;PROSKE D., 2010, FIB B UNPUB.;PROSKE D., 2006, SICHERHEITSBEURTEILU.;PROSKE D., 2007, ARCH 07 C MAD.;PROSKE D., 2009, 19 DRESDN BRUCK, V19.;PROSKE D., 2008, ABSCHATZUNG ANPRALLK.;PROSKE D., 2007, EGU 2007.;PROSKE D, 2003, THESIS.;PURTAK F., 2001, THESIS.;PURTAK F., 2004, 22 CAD FEM US M 2004.;RICKENMANN D, 1999, NAT HAZARDS, V19, P47, DOI 10.1023/A:1008064220727.;SCHLEGEL R, 2004, THESIS.;SCHLEGEL R., 2003, 21 CAD FEM US M 2003.;SCHUEREMANS L., 2001, THESIS.;SIMANDL T, 2006, BETON- STAHLBETONBAU, V101, P722.;UIC INTERNATIONAL UNION OF RAILWAYS, 2005, IMPR ASS OPT MAINT D.;WEBER W.

During heavy rainfall events the capacity of urban drainage systems can be exceeded, resulting in complex flow interactions between surface and pipe system via manholes and street inlets. The flow patterns of accidently spilled hazardous substances can be quite complex. In this study, we implemented a particle based transport model for fast prediction of travel paths of contaminants after a spill during a flash flood. The model calculates mixing and dispersion in the pipe system and on the surface by using a random-walk approach. It is applied to an urban catchment of 5 km(2). Influence of pipe to surface coupling due to the additional transport paths is demonstrated. The model is based on pre-calculated flow fields and can forecast potential contaminated areas within less than one minute.",REAL TIME PREDICTION; SOLUTE TRANSPORT; PARTICLE MODEL,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,none,"SAMANN, R (REPRINT AUTHOR), LEIBNIZ UNIV HANNOVER, INST FLUID MECH \& ENVIRONM PHYS CIVIL ENGN, HANNOVER, NH, GERMANY.;SAMANN, ROBERT, NEUWEILER, INSA, GRAF, THOMAS, LEIBNIZ UNIV HANNOVER, INST FLUID MECH \& ENVIRONM PHYS CIVIL ENGN, HANNOVER, NH, GERMANY.",10.1007/978-3-319-99867-1\_121,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","MANNINA, G","FEDERAL MINISTRY OF EDUCATION AND RESEARCH -BMBF, GERMANYFEDERAL MINISTRY OF EDUCATION \& RESEARCH (BMBF) [03G0846A]","978-3-319-99867-1, 978-3-319-99866-4",1865-3529,,701-705,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,,2019,ISI000482068800121,10,"ENGINEERING, WATER RESOURCES",2,"ENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL, ENGINEERING, CIVIL, WATER RESOURCES",SAEMANNHYDROMECH.UNI-HANNOVER.DE,GREEN ENERGY AND TECHNOLOGY,BN4KD,"NEW TRENDS IN URBAN DRAINAGE MODELLING, UDM 2018","SAMANN, R (REPRINT AUTHOR), LEIBNIZ UNIV HANNOVER, INST FLUID MECH \& ENVIRONM PHYS CIVIL ENGN, HANNOVER, NH, GERMANY",ISI,LEIBNIZ UNIV HANNOVER,LEIBNIZ UNIV HANNOVER,,"SAMANN R, 2019, NEW TRENDS IN URBAN DRAINAGE MODELLING, UDM 2018","SAMANN R, 2019, NEW TRENDS IN URBAN DRAINAGE MODELLING, UDM 2018",FALSE,2,0,0,1,0,3_6,4,1,2

So a preventive evacuation must be decided and completed before such a breach occurs but the authorities would have to assume the heavy consequences if in the end, no such breach happens. (I) the decision to evacuate must be based on an unambiguous criteria, when the predicted level of the flood rises above a safe level, indicating a likely breach in the dikes. (Ii) alas, neither the flood prediction models nor the dike-breach detection plans are free of uncertainties. A way to resolve the combined uncertainties is to use the measured level of a known flood on d-day, and then try to evaluate the errors inherent to the models and the accuracy of d-day predictions using information from d-1,d-2, ...

This study presents a calibrated flood inundation model using referenced photos, an assessment of the influence of four extreme rainfall events on water depth and inundation area in the hanoi central area. Four types of historical and extreme rainfall were input into the inundation model. The modeled results for a 2008 flood event with 9 referenced stations resulted in an r-2 of 0.6 compared to observations. The water depth at the different locations was simulated under the four extreme rainfall types. The flood inundation under the probable maximum precipitation presents the highest risk in terms of water depth and inundation area. These results provide insights into managing flood risk, designing flood prevention measures, and appropriately locating pump stations.",,FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SCALE; WATER; RISK; ADAPTATION; DYNAMICS; CURVES; COPULA; IMAGES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,16,"ACREMAN M.

105,Fang X;Su Dh,An integrated one-dimensional and two-dimensional urban stormwater flood simulation model,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN WATER RESOURCES ASSOCIATION,"Flash flooding is the rapid flooding of low lying areas caused by the stormwater of intense rainfall associated with thunderstorms. Flash flooding occurs in many urban areas with relatively flat terrain and can result in severe property damage as well as the loss of lives. In this paper, an integrated one-dimensional (1-d) and two-dimensional (2-d) hydraulic simulation model has been established to simulate stormwater flooding processes in urban areas. With rainfall input, the model simulates 2-d overland flow and 1-d flow in underground stormwater pipes and drainage channels. Drainage channels are treated as special flow paths and arranged along one or more sides of a 2-d computational grid. By using irregular computation grids, the model simulates unsteady flooding and drying processes over urban areas with complex drainage systems. The model results can provide spatial flood risk information (e.g., water depth, inundation time and flow velocity during flooding). The model was applied to the city of beaumont, texas, and validated with the recorded rainfall and runoff data from tropical storm allison with good agreement.",DRAINAGE; MODELING; STORMWATER MANAGEMENT; SURFACE WATER HYDROLOGY; HYDRAULICS; URBAN WATER MANAGEMENT,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,10,"BEDIENT BP, 2001, SUMMARY JUNE 8 9 FLO.;CHENG XT, 2001, FORECASTING MITIGATI, P393.;CHOW V.T., 1973, J HYDR DIV ASCE, V99, P2023.;CLARK CO, 1945, T AM SOC CIV ENG, V110, P1419.;ESPEY WH, 1966, 3 WAT DEV BOARD.;FRANZ DD, 1997, 974037 US GEOL SURV.;HROMADKA TV, 1987, J HYDRAUL ENG-ASCE, V113, P1422, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(1987)113:11(1422).;IWASA Y, 1980, NUMERICAL METHOD INU, PB2.;JHA AK, 2000, J HYDRAUL ENG-ASCE, V126, P33, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2000)126:1(33).;KATOPODES N, 1978, J HYDR ENG DIV-ASCE, V104, P1269.;LAGUZZI MM, 2001, FORECASTING AND MITIGATION OF WATER-RELATED DISASTERS, THEME C, PROCEEDINGS, P36.;LIGGET JA, 1994, FLUID MECH.;MC CUEN RH, 1998, HYDROLOGIC ANAL DESI.;ROBERSON J.

247,Rappazzo D;Aronica Gt,Effectiveness and applicability of flood barriers for risk mitigation in flash-flood prone mediterranean area,3RD EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT (FLOODRISK 2016),"The new policy of flood risk management is to give more attention to non-structural measures, allowing people to ``live with floods rather than ``fight floods. To protect existing buildings there are two main mitigation strategies: dry proofing and wet proofing. One measure of dry proofing is the shielding, consisting in the use of flood barriers, which can be installed at the entrance of the buildings or at a certain distance from them (including the placing along the banks or crossing a street). These flood protection structures are easier and faster to install rather than sandbags. This paper shows the results applied to a case study in the city of barcellona, sicily, italy that is crossed by a river and suffered a severe inundation in november 2011. To study the effectiveness of using these flood barriers, a 2d hydrodynamic model has been used: the barriers has been placed along a road to inhibit the flow from flooding the protected area. While in north europe these types of barriers are commonly used, because those areas are typically interested in clear water floods, in italy flash floods and mud-debris-flows are more frequent and limit their use. The purpose of this work is to verify if these types of barriers are effective when placed along mediterranean river courses and, especially, to be sure about their stability while subjected to the hydrodynamic effects of these kind of events. To gain this aim, the computed stresses from the modelling have been compared with the stability values of the barriers provided by the producers, evaluating barriers' stability against overturning and sliding. Simulations show how the flood barriers can mitigate the hydraulic risk, being able to withstand the hydrodynamic pressures and managing to divert the flow of water, thus avoiding that the flood water hits very exposed areas.",,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,"ARONICA G., 1998, ASCE J WATER RESOURC, V124.;ARONICA GIUSEPPE T., 2012, UNC MOD HYDR WORKSH.;ASHLEY R.

The aim of this study was to determine whether nonstructural flood countermeasures would help prevent flash floods in the upstream area of the upper chao phraya river basin, and control the volume of floodwaters reaching the downstream area. Numerical models were used to quantify the effects of nonstructural measures, namely land use regulation, reforestation, and retention areas, and to examine how efficient these proposed nonstructural approaches would have been during the severe flood events that occurred in 1995, 2006 and 2011. Three scenarios, reforestation, retention areas, and the combination of reforestation and retention areas, were developed for these nonstructural flood countermeasures, as outlined in the thai master plan for water resources management. Their effectiveness in the upper chao phraya river basin was quantitatively assessed by comparing the model results for the actual conditions with the scenario results. Results showed that the proposed nonstructural measures had considerable potential to reduce peak discharges and flood volumes in the upper chao phraya river basin. Integration of these proposed nonstructural flood countermeasures with the existing countermeasures in the chao phraya river basin may be the most practical way to cope with the challenges of future flood disasters.

538,Lund Nsv;Borup M;Madsen H;Mark O;Arnbjerg-Nielsen K;Mikkelsen Ps,Integrated stormwater inflow control for sewers and green structures in urban landscapes,NATURE SUSTAINABILITY,"Cities increasingly use real-time control of combined sewer systems and green infrastructure to decrease emissions to surface waters, and incorporate infrastructure into the urban landscape to reduce flooding from short, intense rainfall events called cloudbursts, which can cause flash flooding. Inspired by the `smart cities' agenda, we propose the use of integrated stormwater inflow control to dynamically activate cloudburst conveyance infrastructure in the urban landscape as well as green storage elements more often than originally intended. This control facilitates synergy between sewers, green infrastructure and the urban landscape, and has lower environmental impacts than isolated control approaches. A simulated, yet realistic, case study in copenhagen, denmark, shows that combined sewage emissions can be eliminated or reduced substantially in this manner. Other potential benefits include increasing amenity value and educating citizens, for example. The results suggest that the proposed control concept potentially provides a viable path towards more resilient, liveable and sustainable cities.",,MODEL-PREDICTIVE CONTROL; REAL-TIME CONTROL; CLIMATE-CHANGE; DRAINAGE SYSTEMS; ADAPTATION; MANAGEMENT; IMPACT; OVERFLOWS; SUSTAINABILITY; RESILIENCE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,none,"LUND, NSV, MIKKELSEN, PS (REPRINT AUTHOR), TECH UNIV DENMARK, DEPT ENVIRONM ENGN, LYNGBY, DENMARK.;LUND, NADIA SCHOU VORNDRAN, BORUP, MORTEN, ARNBJERG-NIELSEN, KARSTEN, MIKKELSEN, PETER STEEN, TECH UNIV DENMARK, DEPT ENVIRONM ENGN, LYNGBY, DENMARK.;MADSEN, HENRIK, MARK, OLE, DHI, HORSHOLM, DENMARK.",10.1038/S41893-019-0392-1,"MACMILLAN BUILDING, 4 CRINAN ST, LONDON N1 9XW, ENGLAND",,REALDANIA THROUGH THE `KLIMASPRING' PROGRAMME AS PART OF THE `SMART CITIES WATER SOLUTIONS' PROJECT; INNOVATION FUND DENMARK THROUGH THE `WATER SMART CITIES' PROJECT,,2398-9629,11,1003-1010,NATURE PUBLISHING GROUP,2,2019,ISI000496824100008,58,"SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY",16,"GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES",NALUENV.DTU.DK PSMIENV.DTU.DK,,JN3UE,,"LUND, NSV, MIKKELSEN, PS (REPRINT AUTHOR), TECH UNIV DENMARK, DEPT ENVIRONM ENGN, LYNGBY, DENMARK",ISI,TECH UNIV DENMARK,TECH UNIV DENMARK,,"LUND NSV, 2019, NAT SUSTAIN","LUND NSV, 2019, NAT SUSTAIN",FALSE,1,6,1,0,0,6,4,1,2

This paper introduces and applies a stochastic modeling methodology to assess the impact of multihazard events. Most cities are exposed to multiple types of extreme events, sometimes simultaneously, and focusing on single events may lead to inadequate design recommendations. By assigning failure probabilities of road segments and by estimating road failure through monte carlo simulation, roads and areas that are particularly vulnerable to multihazard events can be detected. The performance of the large-scale road network of the tokai region in japan (prone to both typhoons and earthquakes) is analyzed by considering three scenarios of hazards: flash flood, earthquake, and the combination of both hazards. The model considers two key traffic performance characteristics: postdisaster reduced road capacity and hourly variations in travel demand. Overall, several areas in the region are found to be currently severely at risk, thus providing direct information that can help authorities test the effectiveness of future road infrastructure projects.

557,Alves Pbr;Alves Rufino Ia;Cunha Feitosa Ph;Djordjevic S;Javadi A,Land-use and legislation-based methodology for the implementation of sustainable drainage systems in the semi-arid region of brazil,SUSTAINABILITY,"In developing countries, the urbanisation process occurs with empirical urban management, a high increase of impermeable areas, and a lack of connection between water resource management and planning. In brazil, concentrated rainfall and ineffective urban drainage systems add to this context and may impact the population with flash floods. Although sustainable drainage systems (suds) are widely used for flood mitigation, it is still not very well known how those strategies behave in semi-arid regions, where most of the time the weather is very dry. In brazil, flood mitigation still mostly involves structural measures such as larger pipes or channels, with limited guidance for suds use due to the great resistance to change by citizens and managers. This study sought to analyse the efficacy of suds in campina grande, a semi-arid region of brazil.

The spanish mediterranean coastline and its institutional vulnerability issues,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND MANAGEMENT,"Over recent decades, the number of people and the capital invested in flood-prone areas has undergone a significant increase worldwide, particularly in coastal areas. There are several studies that show how the influence of socio-economic factors over local planning authorities seems to be the main reason for exposure increase. This paper explores the causes and consequences of inefficient flood risk governance along the spanish mediterranean coastal municipalities. For that purpose, national and regional flood management policies were contrasted with the outcomes of a spatial intersection between cadastral data at local level and floodable areas, for different return periods (10, 50, 100 and 500 years).

The unesco office in amman, in partnership with the department of antiquities of jordan and the petra archaeological park has engaged in a long term strategy aimed at the prevention and mitigation of natural hazards at the site. Specific attention has been devoted to the case of the petra siq, a 1.2 km naturally formed gorge in the sandstone mountains serving as the only tourist entrance to the site, which is particularly at risk due to its narrow pathway, limited access points and recent active slope processes. Drawing on this approach, the unesco ``siq stability project has been developed to design a strategy towards prevention and mitigation of instability phenomena at the siq of petra. After an initial phase devoted to the reconstruction of geomorphological dynamics and monitoring of active slope processes, the current phase of the project focuses on the implementation of landslide risk mitigation measures, the capacity development of the national authorities and the development and implementation of an awareness strategy on natural hazards.

This study was carried out in the department of upper normandy located in north-western france. To anticipate possible future hazards and damages without depending on meteorological triggers (neither intense rainfall nor synoptic conditions), we combine previous knowledge accumulated on local phenomena to highlight the pre-conditioning factors and identify those areas characterised by the highest susceptibility to risk due to the accumulation of numerous hazards. This approach enables both space and time distribution patterns of natural hazards to be revealed. In space, the risk susceptibility strongly depends on morphology. Populations located at the outlet of large wet valleys, at the final outlets of small basins at a short distance from the plateaus and on the coastal fringe appear to be the most endangered. Even if hazards never occur at the same time, these areas can be affected by different hazards during one year (summer flash floods, floods, winter storm surges). This study identifies 14 sensitive areas along hollow shapes of the study area. Finally, our methodological investigations question the creation of a warning system combining mainland and marine hazards in these 14 outlets.",NATURAL HAZARDS; SPATIAL INTERACTIONS; PARISIAN BASIN; FRANCE,MUDDY FLOODS; STORMINESS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"ALEXANDERSSON H, 2000, CLIMATE RES, V14, P71, DOI 10.3354/CR014071.;ALEXANDERSSON H., 1998, GLOBAL ATMOS OCEAN S, V6, P97.;AUZET A.-V, 1995, ANN GEOGR, V281-282, P187.;BESSON L, 1991, RISQUES NATURELS CON.;BOARDMAN J, 2003, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V6, P69, DOI 10.1016/S1462-9011(02)00125-9.;CARRETERO JC, 1998, B AM METEOROL SOC, V79, P741.;CASPAR R, 1996, METMAR, V172, P33.;CASPAR R, 1988, MET MAR, V141, P12.;CASPAR R., 2010, NOROIS, V215, P115, DOI [10.4000/NOROIS.3273, DOI 10.4000/NOROIS.3273].;CASPAR R., 2007, METEOROLOGIE, V57, P37, DOI DOI 10.4267/2042/18188.;COSTA S, 2004, ACT C ASS INT CLIM C, P277.;COSTA S, 1997, THESIS U PANTHEON SO, V1.;DELAHAYE D., 2008, MODELING PROCESS GEO, P191, DOI DOI 10.1002/9780470611722.CH9.;DELAHAYE D., 2010, QUAPPELLE T ON AUJOU, P301.;DELAHAYE D, 2002, MEMOIRE HABILITATION.;DELAHAYE D, 1999, PAY SAGE AGRAIRES EN, P209.;DOUVINET J., 2008, THESIS U CAEN BASSE.;DOUVINET J, 2013, GEOMORPHOLOGIE, P27.;DOUVINET J, 2010, GEOMORPHOLOGIE, P73.;EVRARD O, 2007, AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON, V118, P149, DOI 10.1016/J.AGEE.2006.02.019.;GALLI F.L, 2001, MET MAR, V49, P79.;GARNIER E, 2012, RISQUES CAHIERS ASSU, V91, P22.;GARRY G, 1997, GUIDE METHODOLOGIQUE.;GAUME E, 2009, J HYDROL, V367, P70, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2008.12.028.;HOFSTEDE JLA, 1997, J COASTAL RES, V13, P1.;JONES PD, 1999, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V42, P131, DOI 10.1023/A:1005468316392.;LAHOUSSE P., 2003, QUATERNAIRE, V14, P189, DOI DOI 10.3406/QUATE.2003.1741.;LAMBERT R., 1996, GEOGRAPHIE CYCLE EAU.;LARUE JP, 2005, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V68, P242, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2004.11.018.;LAUTRIDOU J -P, 1995, QUAESTIONES GEOGRAPH, P201.;LAUTRIDOU JP, 1999, B SOC GEOL FR, V170, P545.;LE BISSONNAIS Y., 2002, EROSION HYDRIQUE SOL.;LETORTU P, 2012, C SHF 1 2 FEVR 2012, P21.;MEGNIEN C., 1980, MEM BRGM, V103.;MEGNIEN C., 1980, MEMOIRE BRGM ORLEANS, V466.;MEGNIEN C., 1980, MEM BRGM, V101, P467.;MEGNIEN C., 1980, MEM BRGM, V102.;MONTZ B.E., 2002, ENV HAZARDS, V4, P1.;PAPY F, 1991, AGRONOMIE, V11, P201, DOI 10.1051/AGRO:19910307.;PERHERIN C, 2010, P XIEM JOURN NATL GE, P609.;PIRAZZOLI PA, 2004, MAR GEOL, V210, P307, DOI 10.1016/J.MARGEO.2004.05.015.;PIRAZZOLI PA, 2007, OCEAN DYNAM, V57, P501, DOI 10.1007/S10236-007-0108-3.;PIRAZZOLI PA, 2006, OCEAN DYNAM, V56, P498, DOI 10.1007/S10236-005-0040-3.;REEVE D.E, 1993, IMA J MANAG MATH, V5-1, P197.;SCHMITH T, 1998, CLIM DYNAM, V14, P529, DOI 10.1007/S003820050239.;SCHOENEWALD N, 2013, THESIS U PANTHEON SO, V1.;SHOM, 1999, INSTR NAUT C2 1 FRAN.;SOUCHERE V., 1995, THESIS INAPG.;ULBRICH U, 2009, THEOR APPL CLIMATOL, V96, P117, DOI 10.1007/S00704-008-0083-8.;VASSEUR B, 2000, GEOL SOC SPEC PUBL, V175, P99, DOI 10.1144/GSL.SP.2000.175.01.09.;WANG X, 2011, CLIM DYNAM, V37, P663, DOI 10.1007/S00382-010-0833-Z.","COSTA, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV CAEN BASSE NORMANDIE, UMR CNRS LETG GEOPHEN 6554, CAEN, FRANCE.;COSTA, STEPHANE, DELAHAYE, DANIEL, LETORTU, PAULINE, CANTAT, OLIVIER, DAVIDSON, ROBERT, UNIV CAEN BASSE NORMANDIE, UMR CNRS LETG GEOPHEN 6554, CAEN, FRANCE.;DOUVINET, JOHNNY, UNIV AVIGNON, UMR CNRS ESPACE 7300, AVIGNON, FRANCE.",,"VIA VALPERGA CALUSO 35, TORINO, 10125, ITALY",,,,0391-9838,1,53-61,COMITATO GLACIOLOGICO ITALIANO,36,2013,ISI000324508600005,51,PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY,2,"GEOGRAPHY, PHYSICAL",STEPHANE.COSTAUNICAEN.FR,,219LN,,"COSTA, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV CAEN BASSE NORMANDIE, UMR CNRS LETG GEOPHEN 6554, CAEN, FRANCE",ISI,UNIV CAEN BASSE NORMANDIE;UNIV AVIGNON,UNIV CAEN BASSE NORMANDIE,,"COSTA S, 2013, GEOGR FIS DIN QUAT","COSTA S, 2013, GEOGR FIS DIN QUAT",FALSE,2,0,1,0,0,0,5,2,1

Because rivers flood annually, most flooding research has focused on river management. Researchers have largely ignored the resource potential of flash floods, as they are less predictable. Here, we describe an innovative project in which disaster management planners in a dryland community in northwestern china treated flash floods as a resource rather than as a threat, and helped the community to benefit from this resource. The project produced ecological benefits (combating desertification), social benefits (flood control), and economic benefits (harvesting water for future use) that improved the community's adaptive capacity and facilitated sustainable development. This example should inspire risk managers to seek ways to transform natural disasters into resources, thereby improving hazard management and promoting community survival and development.",FLASH FLOODS; FLOOD RESOURCES MANAGEMENT; SUSTAINABILITY; PRIVATE ENTERPRISE,WATER-RESOURCES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK-MANAGEMENT; DISASTER RISK; LAND-USE; POVERTY; FLOODPLAIN; ENGLAND; IMPACTS; SCIENCE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,5,"ALEMAYEHU F, 2009, RESOUR CONSERV RECY, V53, P192, DOI 10.1016/J.RESCONREC.2008.11.007.;BARUA A, 2014, REG ENVIRON CHANGE, V14, P267, DOI 10.1007/S10113-013-0471-1.;BURRELL BC, 2007, WATER INT, V32, P342, DOI 10.1080/02508060708692215.;CALIL J, 2015, PLOS ONE, V10, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0132651.;CAO SHIXIONG, 2016, ECOSYSTEM HEALTH AND SUSTAINABILITY, V2, DOI 10.1002/EHS2.1244.;CAO SX, 2009, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V106, P10712, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.0900197106.;[ CHEN XUELIN], 2017, [, JOURNAL OF CHINA HYDROLOGY], V37, P73.;DEMISSIE B, 2015, LAND DEGRAD DEV, V26, P748, DOI 10.1002/LDR.2357.;DI BALDASSARRE G, 2010, GEOPHYS RES LETT, V37, DOI 10.1029/2010GL045467.;FANKHAUSER S, 2011, CLIM POLICY, V11, P1037, DOI 10.1080/14693062.2011.582389.;FORSYTH T, 2013, WIRES CLIM CHANGE, V4, P439, DOI 10.1002/WCC.231.;GAIN AK, 2017, WATER, V9, P16.;GAIN AK, 2016, ENVIRON RES LETT, V11, DOI 10.1088/1748-9326/11/12/124015.;GAUME E, 2009, J HYDROL, V367, P70, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2008.12.028.;GAUVIN C, 2010, ENVIRON MANAGE, V45, P488, DOI 10.1007/S00267-009-9321-9.;HERING JG, 2012, SCIENCE, V336, P1234, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.1218230.;HOCHRAINER S, 2011, CITIES, V28, P53, DOI 10.1016/J.CITIES.2010.09.001.;HOWARTH W, 2017, J ENVIRON LAW, V29, P355, DOI 10.1093/JEL/EQX015.;JAMES LD, 1994, WATER INT, V19, P61, DOI 10.1080/02508069408686201.;JOHNSON CL, 2008, INT J WATER RESOUR D, V24, P513, DOI 10.1080/07900620801923146.;KATES RW, 2007, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V104, P16747, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.0708566104.;KIEDRZYNSKA E, 2015, NAT HAZARDS, V76, P955, DOI 10.1007/S11069-014-1529-1.;KOTTEK M, 2006, METEOROL Z, V15, P259, DOI 10.1127/0941-2948/2006/0130.;LANKFORD B, 2011, J ENVIRON PLANN MAN, V54, P1237, DOI 10.1080/09640568.2011.567127.;LEAHY JV, 1996, J MONEY CREDIT BANK, V28, P64, DOI 10.2307/2077967.;LEE Y, 2018, LAND USE POLICY, V70, P500, DOI 10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2017.11.019.;LUCAS PL, 2014, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V6, P193, DOI 10.3390/SU6010193.;MENDELSOHN R, 2012, CLIM CHANG ECON, V3, P687.;MURRAY V, 2012, J EPIDEMIOL COMMUN H, V66, P759, DOI 10.1136/JECH-2012-201045.;REYNOLDS JF, 2007, SCIENCE, V316, P847, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.1131634.;SCHEUREN J.-M, 2007, ANN DISASTER STAT RE.;SHRESTHA A.

373,Radosavljevic V;Belojevic G;Pavlovic N,Tool for decision-making regarding general evacuation during a rapid river flood,PUBLIC HEALTH,"Objectives: to propose a simple and effective tool for decision-making regarding general evacuation during a rapid river flood. Study design: virtual testing of a tool in a real event. Method: a four-component tool was applied to build an alternative scenario of the catastrophic river flood in obrenovac, serbia, on may 2014. The components of this tool are: (1) the amount of precipitation above the 95th percentile of all previous measurements, (2) upstream river discharge above the 95th percentile of all previous measurements, (3) upstream river level above the 95th percentile of all previous measurements, and (4) worsening of the hydrometeorological situation in the following 48 h. Results: in the early morning of 16 may 2014, a rapid river wave flooded 80\% of the obrenovac territory. There were 13 deaths due to drowning. Application of the study tool shows that these lives could have been saved, as the score to recommend general evacuation was reached 1 day before the flooding. The application of this tool to two previous great floods in serbia shows that the score to recommend general evacuation was reached either 1 day before or on the onset of flash flooding. Conclusions: due to its simplicity, this tool is universally applicable to facilitate decisionmaking regarding general evacuation during a rapid river flood, and it should be further tested in future similar catastrophes.

232,Ahsan Mn,Can strategies to cope with hazard shocks be explained by at-risk households' socioeconomic asset profile? Evidence from tropical cyclone-prone coastal bangladesh,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK SCIENCE,"This article documents the results of an empirical investigation on the complex interplay between diverse coping mechanisms and the socioeconomic asset profiles of coastal households at risk. Focusing on household-level perceptions and responses to cyclone hazards, a case study was carried out in a poor area in bangladesh that is prone to natural hazards. We developed and tested our own analytical models based on the asset approach. We conducted a face-to-face household survey in southwestern coastal bangladesh, in the koyra sub-district, in late 2009. We asked 360 households affected by the may 2009 tropical cyclone aila about their hazard perceptions, preparedness, coping practices, and socioeconomic assets. The results suggest that the majority of households at risk perceive an increasing trend of different climate hazards, with a distinct dominance of tropical cyclones, storm surges, and flash floods in the study area, which resulted in a yearly average economic damage of usd 144 for each household in the first year after aila. However, such damage is significantly and inversely correlated with the number of adopted coping practices. Significant and systematic differences exist between upstream and downstream households in the study area with respect to hazard perception, hazard induced damages, asset accessibility, and adopted diversified coping practices. The empirical findings suggest that the degree of adoption of coping practices depends primarily on elements of socioeconomic asset profile and the duration of the consequences of cyclone hazards. Disaster preparedness training seems to improve at-risk households' degree of information access and eventually leads them to adopt more coping practices to reduce adverse impacts of climate hazards. Area-specific practical modules on coping practices should be incorporated in curricula of disaster preparedness training to make people at risk more resilient to hazard shocks.",CLIMATIC HAZARD RISK; COASTAL BANGLADESH; COPING MECHANISM; CYCLONE AILA,CLIMATE-CHANGE; COPING STRATEGIES; MICROFINANCE INSTITUTIONS; LIVELIHOOD STRATEGIES; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; ADAPTATION; RESILIENCE; VARIABILITY; RESPONSES; CAPACITY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"ADGER W.

18,Scolobig A;De Marchi B;Borga M,The missing link between flood risk awareness and preparedness: findings from case studies in an alpine region,NATURAL HAZARDS,"The low risk awareness of the residents living in flood-prone areas is usually considered among the main causes of their low preparedness, which in turns generates inadequate response to natural disasters. In this paper, we challenge this assumption by reporting on the results of a sociological research in four communities exposed to flood risk in the eastern italian alps. The research design included semi-structured interviews and focus groups with key local stakeholders and a standardized questionnaire submitted to 400 residents. Results revealed that residents felt both slightly worried about flood risk and slightly prepared to face an event. Considerable differences were found between the evaluations of individual subjects as opposed to overall communities. There was also a clear discrepancy between the actual adoption of household preparatory measures and the willingness to take self-protection actions. Overall, the risk awareness was significantly higher among those residents who had been personally affected by a flood in the past, were living in isolated (vs. Urban) communities, in the most risky areas or had a lower level of trust in local authorities. The improvement of residents' knowledge about their environment and the residual risk seemed to be crucial to increase risk awareness, and the same was true for the strengthening of local support networks to foster preparedness. The link between risk awareness and preparedness was not at all straightforward. Results revealed instead the complexity of residents' perspectives, attitudes, behaviours and decisions about risk-related issues.",FLOOD RISK AWARENESS; PREPAREDNESS; ATTITUDE-BEHAVIOUR LINK; COMMUNICATION STRATEGIES,FLASH FLOODS; PROTECTION MOTIVATION; NATURAL HAZARDS; PERCEPTION; MANAGEMENT; DISASTER; COMMUNICATION; WARNINGS; BEHAVIOR; ATTITUDE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,90,"AJZEN I., 1980, UNDERSTANDING ATTITU.;BAAN PJ, 2004, INT J RIVER BASIN MA, V2, P113, DOI [10.1080/15715124.2004.9635226, DOI 10.1080/15715124.2004.9635226].;BECK U, 1992, RISK SOC NEW MODERNI.;BENESSIA A, 2012, SUSTAIN SCI, V7, P75, DOI 10.1007/S11625-011-0150-4.;BORGA M, 2011, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V14, P834, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2011.05.017.;BORGA M, 2010, J HYDROL, V394, P1, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2010.07.048.;BOSHER LS, 2008, HAZARDS BUILT ENV AT.;BURBY RJ, 1981, J AM PLANN ASSOC, V47, P289, DOI 10.1080/01944368108976511.;BURNINGHAM K, 2008, DISASTERS, V32, P216, DOI 10.1111/J.0361-3666.2007.01036.X.;BYE P, 1998, REPORT INDEPENDENT R.;CAROLAN MS, 2007, ORGAN ENVIRON, V20, P5, DOI 10.1177/1086026607300319.;CAVE B, 2009, UNDERSTANDING RESPON.;CIALDINI R.

39,Knocke Et;Kolivras Kn,Flash flood awareness in southwest virginia,RISK ANALYSIS,"Flash floods are one of the most dangerous weather-related natural disasters in the world. These events develop less than six hours after a rainfall event and create hazardous situations for people and extensive damage to property. It is critical for flash flood conditions to be warned of in a timely manner to minimize impacts. There is currently a knowledge gap between flood experts and the general public about the level of perceived risk that the latter has toward the powerful flood waters and how events should be warned of, which affects the communication capabilities and efficiency of the warning process. Prior research has addressed risk perception of natural disasters, but there is little emphasis on flash floods within flood-prone regions of the united states. This research utilizes an online survey of 300 respondents to determine the current state of flash flood awareness and preparation in southwest virginia. Analysis of trends involved the use of chi-squared tests (chi(2)) and simple frequency and percentage calculations. Results reveal that a knowledge base of flash floods does exist, but is not advanced enough for proper awareness. Young adults have a lower understanding and are not as concerned about flood impacts. Increased exposure and perceived risk play a key role in shaping the way a person approaches flash floods. People do monitor flood events, but they are unaware of essential guidance and communication mechanisms. Finally, results suggest that the current method of warning about flash floods is not provided at an appropriate level of detail for effective communication.",FLASH FLOOD; NATURAL DISASTER; RISK PERCEPTION; SURVEY ANALYSIS; VIRGINIA,RISK; PERCEPTION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,51,"ALRECK PL, 2004, SURVEY RES HDB.;BARNETT J, 2001, RISK ANAL, V21, P171, DOI 10.1111/0272-4332.211099.;BEYER JACQUELYN L, 1974, NATURAL HAZARDS LOCA, P265.;CARSELL K.

55,Morss Re;Mulder Kj;Lazo Jk;Demuth Jl,"How do people perceive, understand, and anticipate responding to flash flood risks and warnings? Results from a public survey in boulder, colorado, usa",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"This study investigates flash flood forecast and warning communication, interpretation, and decision making, using data from a survey of 418 members of the public in boulder, colorado, usa. Respondents to the public survey varied in their perceptions and understandings of flash flood risks in boulder, and some had misconceptions about flash flood risks, such as the safety of crossing fast-flowing water. About 6\% of respondents indicated consistent reversals of us watch-warning alert terminology. However, more in-depth analysis illustrates the multi-dimensional, situationally dependent meanings of flash flood alerts, as well as the importance of evaluating interpretation and use of warning information along with alert terminology. Some public respondents estimated low likelihoods of flash flooding given a flash flood warning, these were associated with lower anticipated likelihood of taking protective action given a warning. Protective action intentions were also lower among respondents who had less trust in flash flood warnings, those who had not made prior preparations for flash flooding, and those who believed themselves to be safer from flash flooding. Additional analysis, using open-ended survey questions about responses to warnings, elucidates the complex, contextual nature of protective decision making during flash flood threats. These findings suggest that warnings can play an important role not only by notifying people that there is a threat and helping motivate people to take protective action, but also by helping people evaluate what actions to take given their situation.

150,Yankson Pwk;Owusu Ab;Owusu G;Boakye-Danquah J;Tetteh Jd,"Assessment of coastal communities' vulnerability to floods using indicator-based approach: a case study of greater accra metropolitan area, ghana",NATURAL HAZARDS,"Coastal towns along the coast of africa are among the most vulnerable to climate change impacts such as flooding and sea level rise. Yet, because coastal conditions in many parts of the region are poorly understood, knowledge on which population groups are at the most risk is less known, particularly in the greater accra metropolitan area (gama) of ghana, where the capital city accra is located. Without adequate information about the risk levels and why, the implementation of locally appropriate adaptation plans may be less effective. This study enriches our understanding of the levels of flood risks along the coast of gama and contributes knowledge to improve understanding of place-specific adaptation plans. The study uses data from a 300-household survey, stakeholder meetings, and interviews with local community leaders to construct an integrated vulnerability index. The index includes seven components made up of: dwelling type, house and house environment, household socioeconomic characteristics, experience and perception of flood risk, household and community flood adaptation strategies, house location, and physical characteristics. Our findings show that exposure to floods, particularly from local flash floods is relatively high in all communities. However, significant differences in sensitivity and adaptive capacity of the communities were observed due to differences in location, socioeconomic characteristics, and perception of risks to flooding and sea level rise. The complexity of factors involved in the determination of local-level vulnerability requires that the implementation of adaptation strategies needs to involve cross-sectorial partnerships, involving local communities, in building a comprehensive multi-risk adaptation strategy.",CLIMATE CHANGE; FLOODING; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; COASTAL CITIES; ACCRA; GHANA,CLIMATE-CHANGE; SETTLEMENTS; DISTRICT; BASIN; MODEL; ZONE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,6,"ABOAGYE D, 2012, J ENV EARTH SCI, V2, P2224.;ADDO KA, 2013, JAMBA-J DISASTER RIS, V5, DOI 10.4102/JAMBA.V5I1.60.;AMOAKO C, 2015, INT J URBAN SUSTAIN, V7, P109, DOI 10.1080/19463138.2014.984720.;[ANONYMOUS], 2008, HDB CONSTRUCTING COM.;[ANONYMOUS], 2015, DAILY GRAPHIC.;ANTWI EK, 2015, WEATHER CLIM EXTREME, V10, P56, DOI 10.1016/J.WACE.2015.10.008.;APPEANING AK, 2014, COAST MARINE RES, V2, P1, DOI DOI 10.12966/CMR.01.01.2014.;BATES B.

181,Rahman Hmt;Mia Me;Ford Jd;Robinson Be;Hickey Gm,Livelihood exposure to climatic stresses in the north-eastern floodplains of bangladesh,LAND USE POLICY,"In this paper, we seek to better understand the temporal and spatial aspects of climatic stress on local resource production systems and resource-use behaviors by including the perspectives of resource-dependent communities. Field research was conducted over a nine-month period in the remote north-eastern floodplain communities of bangladesh, considered one of the most climate-vulnerable, least developed and under-studied regions in the country. This area is heavily dominated by wetland ecosystems, and subjected to regular seasonal flood and extreme rainfall events. Beyond these regular stresses, flash-floods and drought are the two most destructive climatic stresses on livelihood sustainability in the area. Data were collected in 12 villages bordering two significant wetlands (hakaluki haor and tanguar haor), involving focus group discussions (n=14), key informant interviews (n=35) and household surveys (n=356). Our results show that climatic stresses on rural livelihoods are catalyzed by human-induced environmental degradation and local resource use behaviors, contextual features that include both socio-economic and bio-physical properties. A climatic event appeared as a stress to livelihood sustainability when it happened in an untimely manner (e.g., flooding during resource harvesting periods) and directly affected the production process (e.g., agriculture and fisheries). We also found that human stress perceptions varied with the level of locally-driven innovation and adoption of technologies, which supports the important role of local experience and knowledge in adaptation planning. Further research is needed into how communities in different settings are already organizing to manage perceived climatic stresses, including traditional knowledge systems, local innovation networks and livelihood practices to help better con-textualize adaptation policy.",STRESS ASSESSMENT; LIVELIHOOD EXPOSURE; PARTICIPATORY APPROACHES; ADAPTATION PLANNING; COMPLEXITY,MULTIPLE STRESSORS; SUSTAINABLE LIVELIHOODS; CHANGE VULNERABILITY; RESOURCE-MANAGEMENT; CHANGE ADAPTATION; FOCUS GROUP; COMMUNITIES; FRAMEWORK; RAINFALL; FARMERS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,"ADGER W.

The disaster-affected communities consist of three barangays purposively selected based on their topographical characteristics lowland upland and coastal. The 107 respondents from the three selected barangays were grouped according to their biophysical characteristic, socio-economic characteristic, past experience with disaster, and emergency preparedness and adaptation strategies to disasters characteristics. The main assumption is that vulnerability to disaster such as flash floods and mudslides was dependent on these factors and since a significant number of residents were farmers, the clusters were named as low vulnerable upland farmers, law vulnerable lowland non-farmers, high vulnerable coastal farmers and high vulnerable coastal non-farmers. The clusters in the coastal, low-lying areas whose residents were either farmers or non farmers were considered the most highly vulnerable communities mainly because they were relatively poorer, less prepared for disaster and hadlimited strategies for adaption.

198,Ryan B,Establishing information seeking pathways in slow and flash floods,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,"The purpose of this paper is to investigate information seeking behaviour of people involved in slow and flash flood disasters, specifically how they received the first alert, where they then turned for more information, and what their main sources and forms were. An online and mailed survey based on models of problem-specific information seeking and risk information for natural hazards secured responses from australians who had experienced flash flood (n=91) and slow flood (n=41). It found that information pathways taken by individuals are different for slow and flash floods, but the set of information forms and sources used are similar. `other people', television and news and weather websites were predominant sources and forms in flash flood, and online sources, television and radio predominant in slow flood. The importance of other people and mainstream media (including their online sites) in information behaviour means that mainstream media should remain an important component of information efforts by agencies.

The present paper seeks to study the impact of religion, culture, customs and rituals of this small himalayan ladakhi society in directly or indirectly influencing disaster response and recovery mechanisms. It would also explore the impact of behavior, perceptions and responses of ladakhi communities in times of disasters.

G. Floods). The current study explores the community awareness and perception on flash floods and their role in fostering social resilience, in relation to the mitigation measures carried out by local authorities. The study-area is located in the bend subcarpathians (romania), a region known for its high seismicity and dynamics of hydro-geomorphic processes (e. G. Floods/flash floods, landslides). The area proved its high exposure to flash floods in small river catchments (below 200 km(2)), during some recent major events (e. G. 2005, 2010), which impacted significantly the local rural communities, determining great losses to their assets, as well as psychological effects. The current research relies on a questionnaire-based survey which was conducted in the summer of 2014 and addressed to 50 households form seven rural settlements, significantly affected by flash floods. Therewith, several structured interviews were held with local authorities (e. G. Local decision-makers, county civil protection inspectors). The questionnaire survey provides some valuable insight into the local human vulnerability to environmental change and extreme hydro-meteorological events, aiming to outline the previous personal experience, people's awareness and worrying, as well as the post-disaster level of preparedness. The survey underlined some discrepancies between people's perception on the local authority's reaction during and post-event and the local authorities' perception on their response and preparedness measures. Moreover, a high interest of local authorities to access scientific data (e. G. Flash flood hazard and risk maps, climate change projections) in order to support the development of adequate mitigation measures, was also noticed. However, the lack of financial support is still limiting factor in their implementation, as well as the development of long-term strategies.",FLASH FLOODS; AWARENESS; WORRY; PREPAREDNESS; BEND SUBCARPATHIANS,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,1,"BRADFORD RA, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P2299, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-2299-2012.;CHENDES V., 2014, SCI C NAT I HYDR WAT.;CHENDES V, 2011, RESURSELE APA DIN SU.;MICELI R, 2008, J ENVIRON PSYCHOL, V28, P164, DOI 10.1016/J.JENVP.2007.10.006.;RAAIJMAKERS R, 2008, NAT HAZARDS, V46, P307, DOI 10.1007/S11069-007-9189-Z.;SHEN X., 2009, THESIS U BONN GERMAN.;WHITE GF, 1988, RISK ANAL, V8, P171, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.1988.TB01167.X.","DANA, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), ROMANIAN ACAD, INST GEOG, BUCHAREST, ROMANIA.;DANA, MICU, MIHAELA, SIMA, MONICA, DUMITRASCU, INES, GRIGORESCU, CARMEN, DRAGOTA, ROMANIAN ACAD, INST GEOG, BUCHAREST, ROMANIA.",,"1 ANDREY LYAPCHEV BLVD, SOFIA, 1797, BULGARIA",,,978-619-7105-36-0,1314-2704,,317-324,STEF92 TECHNOLOGY LTD,,2015,ISI000371663400041,7,"GEOLOGY, WATER RESOURCES",5,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, WATER RESOURCES",,INTERNATIONAL MULTIDISCIPLINARY SCIENTIFIC GEOCONFERENCE-SGEM,BE4FY,"WATER RESOURCES, FOREST, MARINE AND OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS, SGEM 2015, VOL I","DANA, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), ROMANIAN ACAD, INST GEOG, BUCHAREST, ROMANIA",ISI,INST GEOG,INST GEOG,,"DANA M, 2015, WATER RESOURCES, FOREST, MARINE AND OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS, SGEM 2015, VOL I","DANA M, 2015, WATER RESOURCES, FOREST, MARINE AND OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS, SGEM 2015, VOL I",FALSE,0,0,3,0,0,2_4,6,2,4_5

Developments on these flood plains will be exposed to the risk of flooding. The klang valley is well known for its serious problems with flash floods: they generally occur four to five times a year and sometimes more often. Two to three hours of heavy rain is enough to cause the river in the klang valley to reach its peak discharge. Flash floods have led to intangible psychological impacts on the effected residents. This research will discuss the psychological impacts of flash flooding in two residential areas with different levels of living community and different housing constructions.

320,Choudhury Mui;Haque Ce,``we are more scared of the power elites than the floods: adaptive capacity and resilience of wetland community to flash flood disasters in bangladesh,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,"Studies on disaster risk reduction primarily centers on the research streams of vulnerability and resilience. The concept of adaptive capacity is central to both streams of study and has profound implications for disaster risk reduction. Drawing insights from both streams, we examined the adaptive capacity of wetland communities with regards to flash flood disasters. Focusing on societal dimensions, we investigated how the interplay of institutions, community power structures, and human agency shape adaptive capacity of wetland communities. We employed the ``dominant-less dominant research methodological framework, and followed a 4-tier study design: i) a household survey, ii) a semi-structured questionnaire survey, iii) oral history interviews, and iv) key informant interviews. Our findings revealed that wetland communities in the region are highly vulnerable to flash flood hazards. Local community members were conditioned, chiefly by the asymmetrical social power structure, to feel helpless in the face of natural disasters. Their reactive recovery measures have resulted in maladaptation and in their becoming passive towards risk mitigation for future floods. However, transformative patterns were also observed in a large proportion of the population, wherein community members modified or changed their behavior to achieve longer-term sustainability and risk mitigation. We concluded that in designing development interventions to enhance adaptive capacity, consideration must be given to the diverse range of skills and educational development among the local population.

It presents a study of the ways that the french ``actors manage forecast uncertainties during a flash flood warning process. In order to better understand the role of forecasts' uncertainties in decision making, we focused on the actions people took and how what they say explains their actions. The practices of actors involved in warnings for the vidourle watershed (gard, france), in particular, are analyzed using a practice-based approach. A set of categories of the ``actors was developed based on their descriptions of the problems they faced during the flash flood warning, independent of their socio-professional status and position in the warning chain. Five actor profiles result from this: translators, managers, committed, navigators and vulnerable. For each profile, specific action contexts are defined, determining how each deals with uncertainty.",,CLIMATE-CHANGE; KNOWLEDGE; SCIENCE; POLICY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,4,"ADGER WN, 2005, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V15, P77, DOI [10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2005.03.001, 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2004.12.005].;[ANONYMOUS], 1919, BIBLIOTHEQUE, V10/ 18.;BALK HH, 1945, ECON GEOGR, V21, P104, DOI 10.2307/141064.;BAUER G, 1976, RURBANISATION VILLE.;BLOOR DAVID, 1976, KNOWLEDGE SOCIAL IMA.;CARLILE PR, 2002, ORGAN SCI, V13, P442, DOI 10.1287/ORSC.13.4.442.2953.;CARSELL K.

It is essential for public policies to understand how the population reacts to a particular risk. In this paper we have performed a study that quantitatively measures perceptions of flooding and resilience to flooding in the city of colima-villa de alvarez, mexico 2018-2019. A resilience index has been applied to ten zones of the city. In our research we assessed risk perception through a city-wide survey with questions based on a likert scale. An analysis was performed on public knowledge of the existing security protocols for floods and evaluated the public perception of the availability of critical services, such as fresh water, electricity, food, drainage, communications and public transport during a flash flood events. This research has identified populated low resilience zones that can be considered as priorities for resource and effort to mitigate floods and their impacts.

533,Aguilar-Barajas I;Sisto Np;Ramirez Ai;Magana-Rueda V,Building urban resilience and knowledge co-production in the face of weather hazards: flash floods in the monterrey metropolitan area (mexico),ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY,"In 2010, flash floods triggered by hurricane alex caused fifteen fatalities in the monterrey metropolitan area (mma). In contrast, an estimated 225 people died in the 1988 hurricane gilbert disaster and reputedly, over 5,000 in the historical flood of 1909. The magnitude of hurricane-related impacts thus appears to be decreasing, indicating higher resilience to this hazard. This paper analyses the process of building resilience to flash floods in the mma over the last several decades. Knowledge co-production plays a significant role in that process, particularly through the nuevo leon state reconstruction council, the multi-institutional, public-private-civil group of stakeholders established to guide and coordinate reconstruction efforts following the hurricane alex disaster. Findings reveal a complex, protracted and incremental resilience building process, conditioned by the nature of the hazard (infrequent but liable to cause significant damages) and contingent upon the city's socioeconomic and institutional local context. This local context is embedded in a highly fragmented national water governance architecture that lacks inter-institutional co-ordination and has limited the city's adaptive responses. Despite definite gains in building resilience, the city faces challenges notably in terms of the conservation and continuing development of knowledge co-produced in the aftermath of disasters.",URBAN RESILIENCE; KNOWLEDGE CO-PRODUCTION; FLOODS; MONTERREY; MEXICO,CLIMATE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,none,"AGUILAR-BARAJAS, I (REPRINT AUTHOR), TECNOL MONTERREY, DEPT ECON, MONTERREY, NUEVO LEON, MEXICO.;AGUILAR-BARAJAS, I (REPRINT AUTHOR), TECNOL MONTERREY, CTR AGUA AMER LATINA \& CARIBE, MONTERREY, NUEVO LEON, MEXICO.;AGUILAR-BARAJAS, ISMAEL, TECNOL MONTERREY, DEPT ECON, MONTERREY, NUEVO LEON, MEXICO.;AGUILAR-BARAJAS, ISMAEL, RAMIREZ, ALDO I., TECNOL MONTERREY, CTR AGUA AMER LATINA \& CARIBE, MONTERREY, NUEVO LEON, MEXICO.;SISTO, NICHOLAS P., UNIV AUTONOMA COAHUILA, CISE CTR INVEST SOCIOECON, SAKAI, COAHUILA, MEXICO.;RAMIREZ, ALDO I., TECNOL MONTERREY, DEPT TECNOL SOSTENIBLES \& CIVIL, MONTERREY, NUEVO LEON, MEXICO.;MAGANA-RUEDA, VICTOR, UNIV NACL AUTONOMA MEXICO, INST GEOG, MEXICO CITY, DF, MEXICO.",10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2019.05.021,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,1462-9011,,37-47,ELSEVIER SCI LTD,99,2019,ISI000474498900005,60,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,6,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES,IAGUILARTEC.MX,,IH4YV,,"AGUILAR-BARAJAS, I (REPRINT AUTHOR), TECNOL MONTERREY, DEPT ECON, MONTERREY, NUEVO LEON, MEXICO",ISI,CTR AGUA AMER LATINA AND CARIBE;UNIV AUTONOMA COAHUILA;UNIV NACL AUTONOMA MEXICO,NOTREPORTED,,"AGUILAR-BARAJAS I, 2019, ENVIRON SCI POLICY","AGUILAR-BARAJAS I, 2019, ENVIRON SCI POLICY",FALSE,0,0,3,0,0,1,6,1,1
561,Nga Thanh Thi Pham Nttp;Duy Nong Dn;Garschagen M,Farmers' decisions to adapt to flash floods and landslides in the northern mountainous regions of vietnam,JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,"Understanding household's decision making in agricultural production to natural hazards is significant for policymakers and extension organizations in supporting farmers to optimize adaptive strategies, there are, however, still limited empirical researches that emphasize the determinants affecting the choice of measures in the process of adaptation. This paper explores the decision-making process of rural households in adapting to flash floods and landslides (ff\&ls) by conducting a household survey on 405 purposively selected households in yen bai province, one of the poorest mountainous regions in vietnam. Based on the multi-portfolio framework, the study assumes that farmers have multiple choice of adaptation strategies simultaneously and these adaptation measures are correlative. Multivariate probit models were used to figure out the household decision making process in adapting to ff\&ls. Survey results showed that changing cropping patterns, crop variegation, diversifying types of crop varieties, as well as managing and implementing crop protection (soil and plant) are the primary adaptation measures applied by local farmers. Furthermore, lack of money, inadequate support from local government, shortage of machinery and technical equipment, as well as insufficient knowledge about ff\&ls were listed as major constraints in the study area. The mvp analysis indicated that all farmers' perception, socio-economic, farming features, and institutional conditions strongly influence the farmers' adaptation decisions regarding ff\&ls. Future policies may therefore need to consider these major contributing factors with appropriate interventions to facilitate suitable adaptations for local farmers.",ADAPTATION; FLASH FLOODS AND LANDSLIDES; YEN BAI PROVINCE; VIETNAM; LIVELIHOOD STRATEGY; MULTIVARIATE PROBIT MODEL,CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER CONSERVATION; SUBSISTENCE FARMERS; SOIL CONSERVATION; LAND ALLOCATION; ADOPTION; DETERMINANTS; TECHNOLOGY; PARTICIPATION; UNCERTAINTY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"PHAM, NTT (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNITED NATIONS UNIV, INST ENVIRONM \& HUMAN SECUR, BONN, GERMANY.;NGA THANH THI PHAM, UNITED NATIONS UNIV, INST ENVIRONM \& HUMAN SECUR, BONN, GERMANY.;NGA THANH THI PHAM, THAI NGUYEN UNIV AGR \& FORESTRY, THAI NGUYEN, VIETNAM.;DUY NONG, UNIV BONN, INST FOOD \& RESOURCE ECON, CTR DEV RES, BONN, GERMANY.;GARSCHAGEN, MATTHIAS, LUDWIG MAXIMILIAN UNIV MUNCHEN LMU, DEPT GEOG, MUNICH, GERMANY.",10.1016/J.JENVMAN.2019.109672,"24-28 OVAL RD, LONDON NW1 7DX, ENGLAND",,"VIETNAM INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION COOPERATION DEPARTMENT; UNITED NATIONS UNIVERSITY IN BONN, GERMANY",,0301-4797,,,ACADEMIC PRESS LTD- ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,252,2019,ISI000496035000056,74,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,25,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES,NGA.PHAMEHS.UNU.EDU,,JM2FA,,"PHAM, NTT (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNITED NATIONS UNIV, INST ENVIRONM \& HUMAN SECUR, BONN, GERMANY",ISI,UNITED NATIONS UNIV;THAI NGUYEN UNIV AGR AND FORESTRY;UNIV BONN;LUDWIG MAXIMILIAN UNIV MUNCHEN LMU,UNITED NATIONS UNIV,,"NGA THANH THI PHAM NTTP, 2019, J ENVIRON MANAGE","NGA THANH THI PHAM NTTP, 2019, J ENVIRON MANAGE",FALSE,1,0,3,0,3,0,6,2,5
195,Chiang Yc,Exploring community risk perceptions of climate change - a case study of a flood-prone urban area of taiwan,CITIES,"The regional phenomenon of heavy rainfall under global climate change is extremely likely to induce flash floods in flood-prone urban areas and endanger the lives and safety of residents. Due to its low-lying land and the overdevelopment of urban areas, hsinchuang district in new taipei city, situated in the taliaokeng river basin, is subject to routine flooding on some of its streets after heavy rainfall in a changing climate. Faced with the challenge, this study provides insights into risk perceptions of flood-prone communities that should be factored in risk communication to foster adaptive actions in responding to climate change. It is underscored that community perception of climate change is a factor in increasing local awareness of climate risk. The study used driver-pressure-state-impact-response (dpsir) cause-effect model as the information flow framework to assess community vulnerability and risk perceptions throughout semi-structured interview process. The focus was put on how the community risk perceptions were shaped in the context of social amplification of risk in responding to climate change. This methodological approach underscores community risk perceptions are an inherent part of the decision-making process, and helps to enhance adaptive actions of flood-prone communities. The study also underlined the risk communication in groups and social networks that contribute to the integration of structural and non-structural measures to advance understanding of community risk perceptions of future climate.",CLIMATE CHANGE; DPSIR; FLOOD; INTERVIEW; RISK PERCEPTION; VULNERABILITY,CONCEPTUAL-FRAMEWORK; CHANGE ADAPTATION; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; KNOWLEDGE; RESILIENCE; IMPACTS; SCIENCE; AMPLIFICATION; INFORMATION; MANAGEMENT,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"ADGER W.

In the mexican context, the influence of informal practices such as clientelism and cartelisation of the political system produces environmental degradation and vulnerability to disasters within the communities in the study site. This paper contributes to understanding of failed institutional processes and parallel practices that intensify vulnerability to disasters by contrasting the discourses of agents within a peri-urban community in central mexico. Employing the situational analysis approach as a methodological framework, the study identifies divergent views and practices within the community, leading to different responses to disasters and to different perceptions regarding institutional performance. In addition, it finds that institutional decision-making, based only on scientific and technical expertise, has resulted in unintended consequences that influence ongoing vulnerability to floods in the site under review.",FLASH-FLOODS; INSTITUTIONAL FAILURE; MEXICO; PERI-URBAN; VULNERABILITY,POLITICAL-ECONOMY; COMMUNICATION; PERSPECTIVES; STRATEGIES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,4,"AINI MS, 2010, SAFETY SCI, V48, P1286, DOI 10.1016/J.SSCI.2010.04.007.;ALBORES B., 1995, TULES SIRENAS IMPACT.;BANKOFF G., 2004, MAPPING VULNERABILIT.;BENDESKY L., 2007, JORNADA.;BIRKLAND T.A., 2009, J CONTING CRISIS MAN, V17, P146, DOI DOI 10.1111/J.1468-5973.2009.00575.X.;BLYTH M, 2005, WEST EUR POLIT, V28, P33, DOI 10.1080/0140238042000297080.;BUEHLER R, 1994, J PERS SOC PSYCHOL, V67, P366, DOI 10.1037/0022-3514.67.3.366.;CAMACHO PICHARDO G., 1998, PROYECTOS HIDRAULICO.;CAMACHO PICHARDO G., 2003, ACCESO AGUA UNPROBLE.;CANNON T., 2008, DISASTER PREVENTION, V17, P350, DOI DOI 10.1108/09653560810887275.;CARTE L, 2010, GEOFORUM, V41, P700, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOFORUM.2010.03.002.;CLARKE A., 2005, SITUATIONAL ANAL GRO.;CLARKE LEE, 1999, MISSION IMPROBABLE U.;CLEARY M.

213,Scolobig A,Stakeholder perspectives on barriers to landslide risk governance,NATURAL HAZARDS,"European union directives as well as national legislation are placing great emphasis on the inclusion of stakeholder perspectives in the governance of risks from natural hazards. This should help decision makers formulate better policies. However, to date, there is little information on stakeholders' perspectives with respect to landslide risk governance. This paper addresses the gap by reporting on research in nocera inferiore, italy. The research is based on a documentary analysis, 43 semi-structured interviews and a survey submitted to 373 residents. The political instability, the unfairness of national funding allocation across municipalities and the residents' lack of knowledge about risk assessment and emergency planning are some of the main barriers to effective risk governance. Moreover, there are divergent, sometimes even opposite, stakeholders' views on several issues, such as the relevance of illegal development in risky areas. The results highlight the importance of addressing these divergent views and including the plurality of voices as a prerequisite for inclusive risk governance. The research provided essential background information for a participatory process, which was designed to support decisions on landslide risk mitigation measures in nocera inferiore (linnerooth-bayer et al. This issue). The methodology will be of more general interest to researchers and policy-makers intent upon including stakeholder perspectives in natural risk governance.",RISK GOVERNANCE; STAKEHOLDER MAPPING AND PERSPECTIVES; RISK PERCEPTION AND COMMUNICATION; DECISION-MAKING; INSTITUTIONAL AND SOCIAL BARRIERS,EARTH SYSTEM GOVERNANCE; FLASH FLOODS; PERCEPTION; COMMUNICATION; VULNERABILITY; ADAPTATION; MANAGEMENT; FRAMEWORK; POLICY; VIEWS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"ADGER W.

Interviews and consultations with the local experts (13 officials from government and other concerned departments) were carried out to understand the institutional challenges in communicating early warnings, whereas three flood-prone communities from different-sized cities (rawalpindi, sialkot and muzaffargarh) were surveyed. A total of 210 samples were collected through household questionnaire surveys to assess their understanding of the local warning system. The analysis revealed that almost half of the community respondents did not receive a warning last time when the flood occurred. Variations were also observed regarding the main source of early warning in the three communities. This study identifies institutional challenges, such as lack of (1) resources to keep an ews equipment operational, (2) community trust, and (3) proper guidelines to communicate warnings. The study calls for an immediate revision of strategies to communicate early warnings to the end-users and to incorporate their feedback in designing/redesigning the early warning mechanisms.",FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT; PREPAREDNESS; RISK COMMUNICATION; RISK PERCEPTION; URBAN FLOODING,CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK MITIGATION; HAZARDS,ENGLISH,"ARTICLE, EARLY ACCESS",ARTICLE,0,none,"RANA, IA (REPRINT AUTHOR), NUST, DEPT URBAN \& REG PLANNING, ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN.;RANA, IRFAN AHMAD, NUST, DEPT URBAN \& REG PLANNING, ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN.;BHATTI, SAAD SALEEM, ULSTER UNIV, SCH GEOG \& ENVIRONM SCI, COLERAINE, LONDONDERRY, NORTH IRELAND.;JAMSHED, ALI, UNIV STUTTGART, INST SPATIAL \& REG PLANNING IREUS, STUTTGART, GERMANY.",10.1080/17477891.2020.1751031,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,1747-7891,,,TAYLOR \& FRANCIS LTD,,,ISI000526306700001,43,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,3,ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES,IRFANRANA90HOTMAIL.COM,,LD8WA,,"RANA, IA (REPRINT AUTHOR), NUST, DEPT URBAN \& REG PLANNING, ISLAMABAD, PAKISTAN",ISI,ULSTER UNIV;UNIV STUTTGART,NOTREPORTED,,"RANA IA, NA, ENVIRON HAZARDS","RANA IA, NA, ENVIRON HAZARDS",FALSE,0,4,0,2,0,0,6,1,1
148,Diakakis M;Priskos G;Skordoulis M,Public perception of flood risk in flash flood prone areas of eastern mediterranean: the case of attica region in greece,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,"Even though flooding is one of the most destructive natural hazards in the mediterranean, causing hundreds of deaths and economic losses and despite the significant efforts of civil protection authorities of all levels to protect human lives and assets, a critical piece of information, that is how the general population perceives flood risk, is not well known, especially in the eastern part of the region. This work uses structured questionnaires to obtain basic information on how the population of one of the largest urban areas in greece and the eastern mediterranean understands flood risk, risk mitigation and to what degree they take protection measures, they trust relevant institutions and they are aware of flood warning and flood protection actions. Then, the study examines potential correlations of the findings with respondents' demographics. Results show that respondents rank floods third in terms of importance behind earthquakes and forest fires that are important risk in the region, although the vast majority believes the risk is increasing, mostly due to anthropogenic factors. Responses illustrate low levels of trust in authorities and low levels of knowledge of protection actions and awareness regarding floods, as well as low levels of preparedness, in terms of taking private mitigation measures. Respondents' characteristics such as age, gender, previous flood experience and marital status are show statistical correlation with responses, as individuals present different perception and levels of knowledge and preparedness. Overall, the findings illustrate the need for better education and awareness campaigns regarding flood risk and mitigation measures.",FLOOD RISK; RISK PERCEPTION; FLASH FLOODS; PUBLIC PERCEPTION; ATTICA; EASTERN MEDITERRANEAN,CLIMATE-CHANGE; MITIGATION BEHAVIOR; SOCIAL PERCEPTIONS; MANAGEMENT; PREPAREDNESS; EXPERIENCE; DISASTER; ATHENS; FATALITIES; HOUSEHOLDS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,6,"ALDERMAN K, 2012, ENVIRON INT, V47, P37, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVINT.2012.06.003.;ALFIERI L, 2015, HYDROL EARTH SYST SC, V19, P2247, DOI 10.5194/HESS-19-2247-2015.;ANDREADAKIS E., 2018, GEOPH RES ABSTR, V20.;ANTROP M, 2004, LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN, V67, P9, DOI 10.1016/S0169-2046(03)00026-4.;ARMAS I, 2009, NAT HAZARDS, V50, P269, DOI 10.1007/S11069-008-9337-0.;BAAN PJ, 2004, INT J RIVER BASIN MA, V2, P113, DOI [10.1080/15715124.2004.9635226, DOI 10.1080/15715124.2004.9635226].;BARBERI F, 2008, J VOLCANOL GEOTH RES, V172, P244, DOI 10.1016/J.JVOLGEORES.2007.12.011.;BARON N, 2015, REG ENVIRON CHANGE, V15, P1145, DOI 10.1007/S10113-014-0701-1.;BARREDO JI, 2007, NAT HAZARDS, V42, P125, DOI 10.1007/S11069-006-9065-2.;BAUMANN DD, 1978, ECON GEOGR, V54, P189, DOI 10.2307/142833.;BECKER G, 2014, J FLOOD RISK MANAG, V7, P16, DOI 10.1111/JFR3.12025.;BIRKHOLZ S, 2014, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V478, P12, DOI 10.1016/J.SCITOTENV.2014.01.061.;BODOQUE JM, 2016, J HYDROL, V541, P665, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2016.02.005.;BONEM EM, 2015, J BEHAV DECIS MAKING, V28, P317, DOI 10.1002/BDM.1848.;BOTZEN WJW, 2009, WATER RESOUR RES, V45, DOI 10.1029/2009WR007743.;BRILLY M, 2005, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V5, P345, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-5-345-2005.;BUBECK P, 2012, RISK ANAL, V32, P1481, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.2011.01783.X.;COLE S.

44,Nchito Ws,Flood risk in unplanned settlements in lusaka,ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION,"Flooding in unplanned settlements in lusaka is expected, even in years of normal rainfall. There is always much discussion of needed action when flooding occurs but, as soon as the seasonal rains stop, the incidents are forgotten. Most of the households affected by flooding are poor and the flooding damages or destroys their homes and belongings, which might have taken years to accrue. Poorer groups may be faulted for settling on sites at risk from flooding, but this is usually because they can find no safer alternative. In addition, as this paper shows, reducing flood risks in one settlement can increase flood risks in others. Local authorities need to be vigilant in stopping settlement in unstable zones and they need to increase awareness of the need for action in settlements already built in flood-prone areas. Ways also need to be sought to provide low-income households with alternatives to informal settlements in flood-prone sites. It is hard to stop people from erecting houses where they see vacant land. Since rain in zambia is seasonal, many marshy areas have been built on during dry periods only to be flooded when the rains come. In the end, it is the poor who lose and a solution needs to be found before more lives and property are lost.",FLASH FLOODS; STAKEHOLDER RESPONSES; UNPLANNED SETTLEMENTS; URBAN POOR,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,22,"CAIRNCROSS S, 1990, POOR DIE YOUNG HOUSI, P158.;CHOOMA B, 2006, TIMES ZAMBIA 0117.;COLLINS J, 1986, LUSAKA ITS ENV, P95.;GILBERT A., 1992, CITIES POVERTY DEV U.;*GOV REP ZAMB, 1996, NAT HOUS POL.","NCHITO, WS (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ZAMBIA, SCH NAT SCI, DEPT GEOG, BOX 32379, LUSAKA, ZAMBIA.;UNIV ZAMBIA, SCH NAT SCI, DEPT GEOG, LUSAKA, ZAMBIA.",10.1177/0956247807082835,"1 OLIVERS YARD, 55 CITY ROAD, LONDON EC1Y 1SP, ENGLAND",,,,0956-2478,2,539-551,SAGE PUBLICATIONS LTD,19,2007,ISI000250908900014,16,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, URBAN STUDIES",7,"ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, URBAN STUDIES",WSNCHITOYAHOO.COM,,230XE,,"NCHITO, WS (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ZAMBIA, SCH NAT SCI, DEPT GEOG, BOX 32379, LUSAKA, ZAMBIA",ISI,UNIV ZAMBIA,UNIV ZAMBIA,,"NCHITO WS, 2007, ENVIRON URBAN","NCHITO WS, 2007, ENVIRON URBAN",FALSE,1,6,0,0,0,5,6,1,2
60,Fuchs S;Karagiorgos K;Kitikidou K;Maris F;Paparrizos S;Thaler T,Flood risk perception and adaptation capacity: a contribution to the socio-hydrology debate,HYDROLOGY AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Dealing with flood hazard and risk requires approaches rooted in both natural and social sciences, which provided the nexus for the ongoing debate on sociohydrology. Various combinations of non-structural and structural flood risk reduction options are available to communities. Focusing on flood risk and the information associated with it, developing risk management plans is required but often overlooks public perception of a threat. The perception of risk varies in many different ways, especially between the authorities and the affected public. It is because of this disconnection that many risk management plans concerning floods have failed in the past. This paper examines the private adaptation capacity and willingness with respect to flooding in two different catchments in greece prone to multiple flood events during the last 20 years. Two studies (east attica and evros) were carried out, comprised of a survey questionnaire of 155 and 157 individuals, from a periurban (east attica) and a rural (evros) area, respectively, and they focused on those vulnerable to periodic (rural area) and flash floods (peri-urban area). Based on the comparisons drawn from these responses, and identifying key issues to be addressed when flood risk management plans are implemented, improvements are being recommended for the social dimension surrounding such implementation. As such, the paper contributes to the ongoing discussion on human-environment interaction in socio-hydrology.",,NATURAL HAZARD; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MITIGATION BEHAVIOR; MOUNTAIN HAZARDS; EUROPEAN ALPS; FLASH FLOODS; MANAGEMENT; VULNERABILITY; AUSTRIA; PEOPLE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,17,"ADGER WN, 2013, NAT CLIM CHANGE, V3, P330, DOI [10.1038/NCLIMATE1751, 10.1038/NCLIMATE1751].;ANGELIDIS P, 2010, WATER RESOUR MANAG, V24, P2467, DOI 10.1007/S11269-009-9563-6.;[ANONYMOUS], 2015, IBM SPSS STAT 21 DOC.;[ANONYMOUS], 2008, REGIONAL AUTHORITY E.;BABCICKY P, 2017, J RISK RES, V20, P1017, DOI 10.1080/13669877.2016.1147489.;BARBERI F, 2008, J VOLCANOL GEOTH RES, V172, P244, DOI 10.1016/J.JVOLGEORES.2007.12.011.;BIRKMANN J, 2013, NAT HAZARDS, V67, P193, DOI 10.1007/S11069-013-0558-5.;BRADFORD RA, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P2299, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-2299-2012.;BRAKENRIDGE G.R., GLOBAL ACTIVE ARCH L.;BREIMAN L, 1984, CLASSIFICATION REGRE.;BUBECK P, 2013, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V23, P1327, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2013.05.009.;BUBECK P, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P3507, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-3507-2012.;BURNINGHAM K, 2008, DISASTERS, V32, P216, DOI 10.1111/J.0361-3666.2007.01036.X.;BURTON I, 1964, NAT RESOUR J, V3, P412.;BURTON I, 1993, ENV HAZARD.;CANOVAS JAB, 2016, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V557, P142, DOI 10.1016/J.SCITOTENV.2016.03.036.;CARTER W., 1991, DISASTER MANAGEMENT, P51.;COLLENTEUR RA, 2015, NAT HAZARDS, V76, P373, DOI 10.1007/S11069-014-1496-6.;COX DR, 1958, J ROY STAT SOC B, V20, P215.;DAMM A, 2013, NAT HAZARDS, V69, P165, DOI 10.1007/S11069-013-0694-Y.;DE MARCHI B, 2007, RISK CONSTRUCTION SO.;DI BALDASSARRE G, 2013, HYDROL EARTH SYST SC, V17, P3235, DOI 10.5194/HESS-17-3235-2013.;DI BALDASSARRE G, 2013, HYDROL EARTH SYST SC, V17, P3295, DOI 10.5194/HESS-17-3295-2013.;DI BALDASSARRE G, 2015, WATER RESOUR RES, V51, P4770, DOI 10.1002/2014WR016416.;DRIESSEN P., 2013, SOC TRANSFORMATIONS.;DUZI B, 2017, J FLOOD RISK MANAG, V10, P253, DOI 10.1111/JFR3.12132.;DZIALEK J, 2013, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V13, P2555, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-13-2555-2013.;FELGENTREFF C, 2003, ERBE, V134, P163.;FELGENTREFF C, 2000, EUR C ADV FLOOD RES, P614.;FISCHHOFF B, 1978, POLICY SCI, V9, P127, DOI 10.1007/BF00143739.;FISCHHOFF B, 1995, RISK ANAL, V15, P137, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.1995.TB00308.X.;FUCHS S, 2008, RISK ANALYSIS VI: SIMULATION AND HAZARD MITIGATION, P289, DOI 10.2495/RISK080291.;FUCHS S, 2015, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V15, P2127, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-15-2127-2015.;FUCHS S, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P337, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-337-2009.;FUCHS S, 2013, SPATIAL DIMENSION RI, P189.;FUCHS S, 2017, ANN AM ASSOC GEOGR, V107, P382, DOI 10.1080/24694452.2016.1235494.;FUCHS S, 2013, NAT HAZARDS, V68, P1217, DOI 10.1007/S11069-012-0508-7.;FUCHS S, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V64, P2129, DOI 10.1007/S11069-011-0081-5.;FUCHS S, 2011, NAT HAZARDS, V58, P609, DOI 10.1007/S11069-011-9825-5.;FUCHS S, 2009, ENVIRON HAZARDS-UK, V8, P52, DOI 10.3763/EHAZ.2009.0007.;GOBER P, 2015, WATER RESOUR RES, V51, P4782, DOI 10.1002/2015WR016945.;GONZALEZ-RIANCHO P, 2015, OCEAN COAST MANAGE, V112, P44, DOI 10.1016/J.OCECOAMAN.2015.05.004.;GOUDIE AS, 2017, CAN GEOGR-GEOGR CAN, V61, P19, DOI 10.1111/CAG.12315.;GROTHMANN T, 2006, NAT HAZARDS, V38, P101, DOI 10.1007/S11069-005-8604-6.;HALL TE, 2009, SOC NATUR RESOUR, V22, P95, DOI 10.1080/08941920802392187.;HARRIES T., 2013, CITIES RISK LIVING P, P45.;HARRIES T, 2008, HEALTH RISK SOC, V10, P479, DOI 10.1080/13698570802381162.;HARRIES T, 2012, ENVIRON PLANN A, V44, P649, DOI 10.1068/A43612.;HARRIES T, 2011, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V21, P188, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2010.09.002.;HARTMANN T, 2017, J FLOOD RISK MANAG, V10, P145, DOI 10.1111/JFR3.12077.;HARTMANN T, 2016, J ENVIRON PLANN MAN, V59, P360, DOI 10.1080/09640568.2015.1012581.;HIGGINBOTHAM N, 2014, REG ENVIRON CHANGE, V14, P699, DOI 10.1007/S10113-013-0529-0.;HINSHAW R.

The city is a large rapidly growing centre (but not a megacity), facing a varied and challenging water situation and anticipated harmful effects of climate change. The methodological approach involves participatory workshops with key stakeholders in urban administration to identify vulnerabilities, and discuss concrete strategies for increasing the adaptive capacity of the most vulnerable areas and sectors. The paper focuses on water resource planning (storm, potable, and wastewater), since it is already a challenging societal issue and one which will become even more critical in the future with climate change. We aim to contribute to improved urban water management for sustainable climate change adaptation in developing countries through an improved methodology of vulnerability assessments, capacity building and social learning, and a deeper empirical understanding of an urban context in central india.",CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION; URBAN PLANNING; PARTICIPATORY ASSESSMENT; INDIA; SLUM POPULATIONS; WASTEWATER DRAINAGE; HEAT WAVE; FLASH FLOOD; SOLID WASTE MANAGEMENT,MANAGEMENT; MODEL,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,"ADB ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK, 2007, FRAM FIN AGR IND RAJ.;ANDERSSON L., 2009, CLIMATOLOGY.;ANDERSSON L., 2010, UN ESCO IAHS KOV C.;ANDRE K., 2013, THESIS, P579.;[ANONYMOUS], 2013, TIMES INDIA.;[ANONYMOUS], 2010, DISTRICT DISASTER MA.;BATES B.

507,Fadul E;Masih I;De Fraiture C,"Adaptation strategies to cope with low, high and untimely floods: lessons from the gash spate irrigation system, sudan",AGRICULTURAL WATER MANAGEMENT,"In arid areas, water diverted from highly uncertain flash floods is often the only source of water for crop production. Stakeholders in spate irrigation systems have developed numerous measures to cope with uncertain water supply related to low, high and untimely floods. This research evaluates the effectiveness of these measures using the mulino decision support system (mdss4) tool which is based on the driving force-pressurestate-impact-response (dpsir) framework. Using data from interviews with 101 randomly selected farmers, 17 water user associations (wuas), and 7 system water managers in the gash spate irrigation system in sudan, we compare the effectiveness with the rate of adoption. The results reveal the most effective measures are 1) pre-flood preparedness, 2) risk sharing measures through water and land management during and after flood by wuas, 3) crop management by farmers, and 4) flexibility in operation by water managers. Unfortunately, the most effective measures are not the most adopted ones. The level of adoption is primarily related to the capacity of the farmers, wuas and water managers to implement the measures without outside support. Generally, measures taken by downstream farmers are less effective than those adopted by upstream farmers due to weak institutional arrangements and lack of adequate resources. Supporting farmers, wuas and water managers for a wider adoption of the existing effective measures will greatly improve irrigation performance and hence food security in the study area.",SPATE IRRIGATION; GASH AGRICULTURAL SCHEME; ADAPTATION STRATEGIES; FLOODS; UNCERTAIN WATER SUPPLY; DPSIR FRAMEWORK,CLIMATE-CHANGE; WATER MANAGEMENT; RESOURCES; PERCEPTIONS; CATCHMENT; DROUGHT; EASTERN; FOOD,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"FADUL, E (REPRINT AUTHOR), MINIST WATER RESOURCES IRRIGAT \& ELECT, HYDRAUL RES CTR, POB 318, WAD MADANI, SUDAN.;FADUL, E (REPRINT AUTHOR), IHE DELFT INST WATER EDUC, POB 3015, NL-2601 DA DELFT, NETHERLANDS.;FADUL, E., MINIST WATER RESOURCES IRRIGAT \& ELECT, HYDRAUL RES CTR, POB 318, WAD MADANI, SUDAN.;FADUL, E., MASIH, I., DE FRAITURE, C., IHE DELFT INST WATER EDUC, POB 3015, NL-2601 DA DELFT, NETHERLANDS.",10.1016/J.AGWAT.2019.02.035,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,"NETHERLANDS GOVERNMENT, NETHERLANDS FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM [23719]",,0378-3774,,212-225,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,217,2019,ISI000464296100020,35,"AGRICULTURE, WATER RESOURCES",9,"AGRONOMY, WATER RESOURCES",E.FADULBASHIRHRC-SUDAN.SD,,HT1AJ,,"FADUL, E (REPRINT AUTHOR), MINIST WATER RESOURCES IRRIGAT \& ELECT, HYDRAUL RES CTR, POB 318, WAD MADANI, SUDAN",ISI,HYDRAUL RES CTR;IHE DELFT INST WATER EDUC,HYDRAUL RES CTR,,"FADUL E, 2019, AGRIC WATER MANAGE","FADUL E, 2019, AGRIC WATER MANAGE",FALSE,1,3_6,0,0,0,0,6,0,1

These flash floods typically occur in relatively small catchments as that of the sucevita river with an area of 199 km(2). The present study focuses on the analysis of the main factors that generate and favour the emergence of flash floods, as well as on the efficiency of structural and non-structural measures which were taken at the level of the communities located in the floodplain of the river. The research is based on the investigation of local authorities by means of questionnaires.

Appropriate guidelines will be needed to develop a robust strategy for improving flood risk management based on advanced technologies, research and practices. The experience gained through the recent eu-funded projects for flash floods, the eu water framework directive and floods directive, and the driver pressure state impact response (dpsir) framework provide useful insights to solve the problems associated with the flash floods in bangladesh. Flood marks, post-flood analysis and witness interviews in floodsite basins of europe provide good practices for improving the flash flood risk management. This paper presents normative conclusions from case studies conducted in feni, bangladesh on how to manage pluvial flood risk resiliently using strategic planning by considering eu-policy, practice and framework. Interviews were conducted, questionnaires, field observations and focus group discussions were undertaken with the affected community with and without flood experience, national water experts, water management practitioners and local authorities responsible for decision-making on flood risk management.

22,Menoni S;Molinari D;Parker D;Ballio F;Tapsell S,Assessing multifaceted vulnerability and resilience in order to design risk-mitigation strategies,NATURAL HAZARDS,"Vulnerability studies have evolved significantly in recent decades. Although not overly theoretical compared with some other fields of science, some important conceptual progress has been made. At the practical level, vulnerability indicators have been used either at a generic level or for particular hazard contexts. However, these indicators are often predictably too narrow in their coverage of aspects of vulnerability. An important need remains to produce more conceptually informed vulnerability indicators or parameters and more satisfactory operational tools to assess weaknesses and resilience in coping with natural risks. In this paper, we present the methodology developed in the context of a recently concluded eu funded project, ensure (enhancing resilience of communities and territories facing natural and na-tech hazards). The resulting vulnerability and resilience assessment framework tool adopts a systemic approach embedding and integrating as much as possible the multifaceted and articulated nature of concepts such as vulnerability and resilience. The tool guides evaluators towards a comprehensive and context-related understanding of strengths and fragilities of a given territory and community with respect to natural extremes. In this paper, both the framework tool and its application to sondrio in italy, which is exposed to flash floods, are presented and discussed. The merits and demerits of the new tool are discussed, and the results of the application to sondrio indicate where data are currently missing, suggesting the kind of data, which will need to be gathered in future to achieve more complete assessments. The results also suggest vulnerability reduction policies and actions and further ways of revising the existing framework tool in the future.",VULNERABILITY; RESILIENCE; INTEGRATED VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; RESILIENCE ASSESSMENT; FLASH FLOODS,NATURAL DISASTERS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,55,"AL-KUWAITI M, 2006, P 2006 INT C COMP EN.;ARMONIA PROJECT, 2007, ASS MAPP MULT RISKS.;BALLIO F, 2010, CONSTRUZIONE SISTEMA.;BARROCA B, 2006, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V6, P553, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-6-553-2006.;BECK U, 1992, RISK SOC NEW MODERNI.;BLAIKIE P, 1994, RISK NATURAL HAZARDS.;CALVI G., 2006, J EARTHQUAKE TECHNOL, V43, P75.;CHAVITEAU C, 2006, INGENIERIES, V46, P15.;CRUETIN JD, 2009, J APPL METEOROLOGY, V16, P115.;CUNY FREDERICK C., 1983, DISASTERS DEV.;CUTTER S.L., 2006, HAZARDS VULNERABILIT.;CUTTER SL, 2000, ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR, V90, P713, DOI 10.1111/0004-5608.00219.;CUTTER SL, 2008, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V18, P598, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2008.07.013.;CYRANOSKI D, 2011, NATURE, V471, P556, DOI 10.1038/471556A.;DEFRA/ENVIRONMENT AGENCY, 2006, FD2321TR DEFR ENV AG.;FOWLER HJ, 2003, WATER RESOUR RES, V39, DOI 10.1029/2002WR001778.;GALDERIS A, 2007, RIV SEMESTRALE I NAZ, P20.;GALLI M, 2007, ENVIRON MANAGE, V40, P649, DOI 10.1007/S00267-006-0325-4.;GRANGER K, 1999, COMMUNITY RISK CAIRN.;GUHA-SAPRI D, 2012, EC IMPACTS NATURAL D.;HEWITT K., 1983, INTERPRETATIONS CALA, V1.;HILLS A, 2005, J CONTING CRIS MANAG, V13, P12, DOI DOI 10.1111/J.0966-0879.2005.00450.X.;HOLLING C.S., 1973, ANNUAL REV ECOL SYST, V4, P1, DOI 10.1146/ANNUREV.ES.04.110173.000245.;HOLLING C.

Both the probabilities and the numbers of fatalities and injuries clearly increase significantly after the flood severity (in terms of the number of inundated buildings) passes a branch point. Below the branch point, it is still possible for fatalities and injuries to occur because of the variability in the data and the uncertainty in the predicted fatality values.

Therefore, methods and tools are required in order to better understand the complexity of the interactions taking place during an emergency, and to analyse the actual roles and responsibilities of the different actors. This paper details the design and implementation of an integrated approach aiming to unravel the complexity of the interaction network based on storytelling, the problem structuring method, and social network analysis. The potential of the integrated approach has been investigated in the lorca (spain) flood risk management case study. (C) 2017 the authors.

It's about to explore the conditions of establishment of a proactive and innovative alert system via smartphones, to cope the risks associated with flash floods. The solution must be thought in way to achieve a major challenge: reducing the gap between a state approach (top-down), which positions and imposed the state as the main official alert source, and the citizen action (bottum-up) which establishes the individual as ``citizen sensor (both in go up or disseminate information) through the use of its smartphone. Addressing this challenge is indispensable if we hope effectively minimize material and human damages especially when high temporal acuity phenomena such as flash floods happen. Consequently, we propose to use smartphone technologies: to reduce the time required to alert and to protect population, to enhance information observed by any people at local scales, to built automatic vigilance based on these ``citizens-sensors, to use field experiment to improve knowledge on flash floods actually available after damaged events, to use geo-location of transmitter sources to alert people located at 5 km around.",SMARTPHONE; APPLICATION; GEOLOCATION; FLASH FLOODS; CITIZEN SENSORS; ALERT; HTML5,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,2,"ARTIGUE G, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P3307, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-3307-2012.;ARTIGUE G., 2010, EPISODE PLUVIOORAGEU.;BADOUX A, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P3091, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-3091-2012.;CALVET M., 2002, GEOMORPHOLOGIE, V8, P35.;CONDER S., 2011, ANDROID WIRELESS APP.;CREUTIN JD, 2009, METEOROL APPL, V16, P115, DOI 10.1002/MET.128.;DE MONTJOYE YA, 2013, SCI REP-UK, V3, DOI 10.1038/SREP01376.;DEFRANCE D., 2014, THESIS.;DOUVINET J, 2011, ESPACE GEOGRAPHIQUE, V40, P31, DOI DOI 10.3917/EG.401.0031.;FEN-CHONG J., 2012, THESIS.;GARAMBOIS PA, 2012, IAHS-AISH P, V351, P581.;GAUME E, 2002, THESIS.;GAUME E., 2009, J HYDROLOGY, V367.;GOODCHILD MF, 2007, GEOJOURNAL, V69, P211, DOI 10.1007/S10708-007-9111-Y.;GOURLEY JJ, 2013, B AM METEOROL SOC, V94, P799, DOI 10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00198.1.;GRAMLICH N., 2008, ANDROID PROGRAMMING.;MARSHALL M.

The methods which are used in the contribution emerge from practical experience as well as from knowledge obtained from the available literature and consultations with experts dealing with the given problem in practice. The foundations of flood risk assessment are hypotheses on the impact of physiogcographical attributes of basins on the origin of floods. The conceptual framework for flood risk assessment of flash floods comes from the definition of a multidimensional conception of flood risk. The proposed methodology consists in the identification of critical points and contributing surfaces from the viewpoint of creation of a concentrated surface flow from flash floods and their adverse impacts on the built-up areas of a municipality. The primary goal of the assessment of risk of contributing surfaces was determining the riskiness of the locality with an ordinal degree (i.e., low, moderate, and high) and providing a foundation for a second stage, called controlling risk. The resulting risk of contributing surfaces is determined as a combination of danger and vulnerability according to a set matrix. Processing and analysis of the input data as well as visualization of the achieved results is carried out in the gis environment (arcgis 9.3, 10) in integration with a spreadsheet of microsoft excel.

Nature-based tourism in the nepalese himalayas, however, is highly vulnerable to change in climatic conditions. This paper proposes a conceptual framework based on jodha's mountain specificities, which include inaccessibility, fragility, marginality, diversity and niche, to examine the impacts and vulnerability of climate change on tourism in the himalayas, with the cases of the three most popular protected areas of nepal - mt everest national park, annapurna conservation area and chitwan national park - located in three physiographic zones. Each physiographic zone differs greatly and hence presents potentially different impacts and vulnerability to climate change. Avalanches and glacial lake outburst floods are the major hazards in high mountains, landslides, debris flows and flash floods are common in the hills, and floods are rampant in lowland terai. The effects of these climate-related hazards on tourism are further exacerbated by mountain characteristics.",HIMALAYAS; CLIMATE CHANGE; NEPAL; NATURE-BASED TOURISM; VULNERABILITY; IMPACTS,ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON; NATIONAL-PARK; INDIA; RAINFALL; CONSTRAINTS; VARIABILITY; RECREATION; PREDICTION; IMPACTS; ENSO,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,57,"AGRAWALA S., 2003, DEV CLIMATE CHANGE N.;ALAM M., 2004, ADVERSE IMPACTS CLIM.;AMELUNG B., 2007, JOURNAL OF TRAVEL RESEARCH, V45, P285, DOI 10.1177/0047287506295937.;BARROS AP, 2003, MON WEATHER REV, V131, P1408, DOI 10.1175/1520-0493(2003)131<1408:MTMITH>2.0.CO,2.;BARTLEIN PJ, 1997, CONSERV BIOL, V11, P782, DOI 10.1046/J.1523-1739.1997.95383.X.;BENISTON M, 2003, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V59, P5, DOI 10.1023/A:1024458411589.;BLAMEY R, 2001, ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS, V74, P117.;BLAMEY R.

384,Ostrowski Mw,Anthropogenic impacts on the formation of flash floods and measures for their compensation,FLOOD ISSUES IN CONTEMPORARY WATER MANAGEMENT,"During the 1990s, frequent occurrences of disastrous floods throughout the world have motivated experts, journalists, politicians, citizens and others to identify reasons for the formation of these floods. Even among experts the reasoning seems fairly subjective at times. Often, under the actual impression of catastrophic damages, basic process understanding gets lost and is replaced by all kinds of irrational assignments of guilt and responsibilities. Some publications and media even suppose that such factors as urbanisation are more important than rainfall for the formation of rare flood events. Quite astonishing is the criticism uttered by individuals and representatives of communities hit by flood damages, even though they have settled, more or less consciously, in the areas endangered by high flood risk, e.g. on flood plains. Yet it has to be clearly remembered that except in few cases, floods are caused by extreme rainfall events. However, anthropogenic impacts related to land use have an influence on the intensity of flood discharge. It must be remembered that each flood event has its own set of causes, which can be categorised as anthropogenic and natural event dependent (meteorology) and event independent. In this paper, results of a model based sensitivity analysis will be presented with respect to quantifying these impacts on floods. The model structure provides an opportunity to consider anthropogenic impacts like land use changes and river training. Some control measures, which appeared suitable to compensate for the anthropogenic impacts, were applied in two case studies.

11,Dorji C,Mental health and psychosocial aspects of disaster preparedness in bhutan,INTERNATIONAL REVIEW OF PSYCHIATRY,"Bhutan has taken the initiative in developing a comprehensive guideline on disaster risk preparedness and management in response to several minor disasters, namely earthquakes and flash floods in the country during the last couple of years. It is now widely accepted that the psychological symptoms of trauma resulting from devastation to lives and livelihood of affected people remain much longer and sometimes throughout their entire life span unless taken care of. Therefore, it is important to include psychosocial components of mental health protection and treatment of the affected persons in disaster risk preparedness and management to make it a comprehensive package. A four-tier system of mental health intervention and counselling has been proposed in line with the existing healthcare system and resources available in the country to make it sustainable. At the core of this programme is the mobilizing and training of volunteers from the community on psychosocial intervention, counselling and rehabilitation, backed up by three layers of trained health workers and mental health professionals.",,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,6,"DORJI C, 2004, COMMUNICATION.;*RGOB, 2005, DIS RISK PREP.","DORJI, C (REPRINT AUTHOR), JDW NATL REFERRAL HOSP, DEPT PSYCHIAT, THIMPHU, BHUTAN.;JDW NATL REFERRAL HOSP, DEPT PSYCHIAT, THIMPHU, BHUTAN.",10.1080/09540260601037979,"4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OX14 4RN, OXFORDSHIRE, ENGLAND",,,,0954-0261,6,537-546,"ROUTLEDGE JOURNALS, TAYLOR \& FRANCIS LTD",18,2006,ISI000242763900008,4,PSYCHIATRY,0,PSYCHIATRY,CHENCHODORJIGMAIL.COM,,115WG,,"DORJI, C (REPRINT AUTHOR), JDW NATL REFERRAL HOSP, DEPT PSYCHIAT, THIMPHU, BHUTAN",ISI,JDW NATL REFERRAL HOSP,JDW NATL REFERRAL HOSP,,"DORJI C, 2006, INT REV PSYCH","DORJI C, 2006, INT REV PSYCH",FALSE,1,4,0,0,0,4,9,0,2
311,Fox-Rogers L;Devitt C;O'neill E;Brereton F;Clinch Jp,Is there really ``nothing you can do? Pathways to enhanced flood-risk preparedness,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Whilst policy makers have tended to adopt an information-deficit model' to bolster levels of flood-risk preparedness primarily though communication strategies promoting awareness, the assumed causal relation between awareness and preparedness is empirically weak. As such, there is a growing interest amongst scholars and policy makers alike to better understand why at-risk individuals are underprepared. In this vein, empirical studies, typically employing quantitative methods, have tended to focus on exploring the extent to which flood-risk preparedness levels vary depending not only on sociodemographic variables, but also (and increasingly so) the perceptual factors that influence flood risk preparedness. This study builds upon and extends this body of research by offering a more solution-focused approach that seeks to identify how pathways to flood-risk preparedness can be opened up. Specifically, through application of a qualitative methodology, we seek to explore how the factors that negatively influence flood-risk preparedness can be addressed to foster a shift towards greater levels of mitigation behaviour. In doing so, we focus our analysis on an urban community in ireland that is identified as `at risk' of flash flooding and is currently undergoing significant flood relief works. In this regard, the case study offers an interesting laboratory to explore how attitudes towards flood-risk preparedness at the individual level are being influenced within the context of a flood relief scheme that is only partially constructed. In order to redress the dearth of theoretically informed qualitative studies in this field, we draw on protection motivation theory (pmt) to help guide our analysis and make sense of our results. Our findings demonstrate that flood-risk preparedness can be undermined by low levels of efficacy amongst individuals in terms of the preparedness measures available to them and their own personal capacity to implement them. We also elucidate that the `levee effect' can occur before engineered flood defences are fully constructed as the flood relief works within our case study are beginning to affect people's perception of flood risk in the case study area. We conclude by arguing that (1) individuals' coping appraisals need to be enhanced through communication strategies and other interventions which highlight that future floods may not replicate past events, and (2) the concept of residual risk needs to be communicated at all stages of a flood relief scheme, not just upon completion.

Few argue that flash flood mitigation is unnecessary, and the need for some mix of measures is generally accepted as preferable to reliance on one or another measure. However, mitigation strategies vary in terms of cost (both in real dollars and human and other resources), acceptability, direct and indirect effects on social, economic, and environmental systems, and in their effectiveness. Yet, there is little work evaluating mitigation strategies with regard to the criteria listed above. The effectiveness of mitigation measures is tested when a flash flood occurs, but these are expensive tests that come too tate.

This requires the development of new approaches to flood management and mitigation for support sustainable urban development. In present study as the measures for mitigation of flash floods, the regulation of river flow by the system of detention reservoirs for flood diversion with dams, which do not need any operation management, are analyzed concerning of far east region of russia. The main objective of this paper is to develop a method for analysis how the dam site selection meets the environmental criterion. The method to justify a selection of self-regulated flood dam parameters, primarily a height of a dam and its location on a water stream, providing minimization of impact on the environment have been developed.

166,Zelenakova M;Diaconu Dc;Haarstad K,Urban water retention measures,STRUCTURAL AND PHYSICAL ASPECTS OF CONSTRUCTION ENGINEERING,"Many cities and urban areas are located in flood plains because land is fertile and flat which is suitable for agriculture and urban development. Rivers provide water supply for domestic, industrial and irrigation uses, they also provide convenient means for navigation, transportation and communication. Cities have large percentage of impervious areas that prevent effective infiltration of rainfall into soil. To have successful flood control and flood risk management, we should consider not only hydraulic and engineering aspects but also socio-economic and environment aspects. Flood management should have involvement of various stakeholders including concerned authorities such as urban planners, civil and water resources engineers, civil disaster defence authorities, health and social services, etc. The best flood mitigation measures from all main points of view - social, economic and environmental are natural water retention measures. Natural water retention measures cover a diversity of measures that are implemented by different sectors or considered in different planning processes dealing with water, food risk management, biodiversity protection, climate change adaptation or urban planning. Some of these measures aim to directly modify the ecosystem, while others focus on changes of practice of economic operators. The paper presents natural water retention measures suitable for application in urban areas. (C) 2017 the authors.

208,Jakubinsky J;Bacova R;Svobodova E;Kubicek P;Herber V,Small watershed management as a tool of flood risk prevention,"EVOLVING WATER RESOURCES SYSTEMS: UNDERSTANDING, PREDICTING AND MANAGING WATER-SOCIETY INTERACTIONS","According to the international disaster database (cred 2009) frequency of extreme hydrological situations on a global scale is constantly increasing. The most typical example of a natural risk in europe is flood there is a decrease in the number of victims, but a significant increase in economic damage. A decrease in the number of victims is caused by the application of current hydrological management that focuses its attention primarily on large rivers and elimination of the damages caused by major flood situations. The growing economic losses, however, are a manifestation of the increasing intensity of floods on small watercourses, which are usually not sufficiently taken into account by the management approaches. The research of small streams should focus both on the study of the watercourse itself, especially its ecomorphological properties, and in particular on the possibility of flood control measures and their effectiveness. An important part of society's access to sustainable development is also the evolution of knowledge about the river landscape area, which is perceived as a significant component of global environmental security and resilience, thanks to its high compensatory potential for mitigation of environmental change. The findings discussed under this contribution are based on data obtained during implementation of the project ``georisk (geo-analysis of landscape level degradation and natural risks formation), which takes into account the above approaches applied in different case studies catchments of small streams in different parts of the czech republic.

Flash flood, long duration flood, and landslides are few examples of them. In this case, communication between victims is a challenging job. This paper presents an idea to overcome these kinds of situations. Different tools have been developed alert about disaster including in flood disaster but during the flood, power failure makes these impossible to work for a long duration while flood is long duration disaster.

253,Bacci M,"Characterization of flood hazard at a municipal level. A case study in tillaberi region, niger",PLANNING TO COPE WITH TROPICAL AND SUBTROPICAL CLIMATE CHANGE,"The occurrence of flooding ranks top among natural disasters in terms of both the number of people affected globally, and the proportion of individual fatalities per case. The potential for flood causalities and damages is increasing in africa due to social and demographic development raising pressure on land use. Furthermore, the evidence of increasingly heavy precipitation due to climate change supports the view that flood hazard is expected to increase in frequency and severity in many areas of niger. Niger is one of the countries most vulnerable to climatic risks, and the tillaberi region is exposed to different typologies of floods: flash floods associated with short, high intensity rainfalls, mainly of convective origin and occurring locally, and floods on larger catchments, such as the niger river, where dangerous episodes derive from a regional combination of precipitations and runoff effects. As such, flash flooding usually impact basins less than 1,000 km(2) with response times of a few hours or less, while large river basins have the response times of several days to months. Investigating these aspects in this area is difficult due to a lack of systematic observational data for flash floods, encompassing data on the flood-generating rainfall at the required space and time detail. This case study aims to support local institutions and organizations in the design and implementation of disaster risk management policies in reducing niger's vulnerability to recurrent natural disasters, as well as integrating the role of local authorities in building community disaster prevention and preparedness. The study proposes a methodology to classify each single municipality in the tillaberi region based on its specific flood hazard characterization.",FLOOD; NATURAL DISASTER; CLIMATE CHANGE; WEATHER EXTREMES,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,"ADGER W.

25,Higgitt Dl,Towards river rehabilitation as an integrated approach to flood management in asian cities,ADVANCES IN GEOSCIENCES VOL 29: HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCE (HS),"Flood management in asian cities has conventionally been approached through structural intervention where floods are regarded as a threat requiring control through engineering infrastructure. Such a command and control paradigm represents a marked transition from the way that monsoon flood regimes have been traditionally perceived across asia. Rapid urbanization and climate change has imposed increasingly difficult flood management challenges as an extension of impermeable surfaces generates rapid runoff and flash flooding, while cities expand into flood-prone areas. Property and communities are placed at enhanced risk. Urbanization reallocates risk as channel and floodplain modification influences flood regimes, while demands for flood protection at certain locations can redistribute risk to other areas. An increasing concern about flood hazard across asian cities questions whether conventional solutions reliant on structural intervention are sustainable. Such questioning is mirrored by an alternative paradigm of rehabilitation in integrated river basin management - a recognition that restoring and sustaining functional river ecosystems with high biodiversity is one of the greatest challenges facing society. Rehabilitation initiatives demand a new approach to river basin management which encourage interdisciplinary activity, particularly between engineers, hydrologists, geomorphologists and ecologists. The paper sets out some preliminary ideas from a research project investigating the potential for river rehabilitation as a central tenet of flood management, with a particular focus on asian cities.",,RESTORATION,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,"ADIKARI Y, 2010, J FLOOD RISK MANAG, V3, P185, DOI 10.1111/J.1753-318X.2010.01068.X.;ADIKARI Y, 2009, 3 UN WORLD WAT DEV.;BRIERLEY G., 2008, RIVER FUTURES.;DUFOUR S, 2009, RIVER RES APPL, V25, P568, DOI 10.1002/RRA.1239.;FARRELLY M., 2011, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, DOI [10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2011.01.07, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2011.01.07].;GREGORY C, 2011, GEOGR COMPASS, V5, P182, DOI 10.1111/J.1749-8198.2011.00411.X.;HIGGITT D., 2011, INNOVATION, V10, P36.;LEBEL L, 2010, INT ENVIRON AGREEM-P, V10, P333, DOI 10.1007/S10784-010-9142-6.;MIN SK, 2011, NATURE, V470, P378, DOI 10.1038/NATURE09763.;NEWELL B, 2002, SC2002WS53 UNESCO.;ORMEROD SJ, 2004, AQUAT CONSERV, V14, P543, DOI 10.1002/AQC.663.;OSTI R, 2011, J FLOOD RISK MANAG, V4, P203, DOI 10.1111/J.1753-318X.2011.01107.X.;WALSH CJ, 2005, J N AM BENTHOL SOC, V24, P690, DOI 10.1899/0887-3593(2005)024\TEXTBACKSLASH\TEXTBACKSLASH[0690:SRIUCT\TEXTBACKSLASH\TEXTBACKSLASH]2.0.CO,2.","HIGGITT, DL (REPRINT AUTHOR), NATL UNIV SINGAPORE, DEPT GEOG, 1 ARTS LINK, SINGAPORE 117570, SINGAPORE.;NATL UNIV SINGAPORE, DEPT GEOG, SINGAPORE 117570, SINGAPORE.",,"PO BOX 128 FARRER RD, SINGAPORE 9128, SINGAPORE","LIN, GF AND SATAKE, K",,"978-981-4405-71-3, 978-981-4405-70-6",,,41-50,WORLD SCIENTIFIC PUBL CO PTE LTD,,2012,ISI000345699400004,17,"GEOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",0,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",,,BB7LD,ADVANCES IN GEOSCIENCES VOL 29: HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCE (HS),"HIGGITT, DL (REPRINT AUTHOR), NATL UNIV SINGAPORE, DEPT GEOG, 1 ARTS LINK, SINGAPORE 117570, SINGAPORE",ISI,NATL UNIV SINGAPORE,NATL UNIV SINGAPORE,,"HIGGITT DL, 2012, ADVANCES IN GEOSCIENCES VOL 29: HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCE (HS)","HIGGITT DL, 2012, ADVANCES IN GEOSCIENCES VOL 29: HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCE (HS)",FALSE,1,3_6,0,0,0,0,9,1,1

The city is considered to be a forerunner in sustainable development amist the rapid urbanization occurring in india. Though, selected under the ``smart city project launched by the indian government, the city faces many urban challenges ineffectively addressed by the current development plan. Haphazard and rapid infrastructural development without any comprehensive plan is leading to urban sprawl that compromises urban green infrastructure across the city. It excludes utilizing benefits of nature and ecosystem services to complement and reduce urban stress. This has led to wetland reductions, reduced water infiltration affecting the water table and causing water shortage, flash floods, significant loss of vegetation cover and biodiversity across the city and increased heat island effects. These issues along with current approach that discounts the importance of ecosystems-based approach has put forward many challenges and a question with regard to sustaining ``green image of the city. To reduce risk against uncertainties, it is imperative to understand human-environment connections that involves diverse values and ecosystem services provided by the natural environment of the cities. Present study is a review of major issues raised due to un-planned development and addresses the feasibility and appropriateness of using the ebdrr approach. Environmental engineering based approaches having potential to transform nagpur city into to a ``smart city can set an example for other indian cities to follow.

This paper presents an output-oriented risk management approach ('parametric governance'). Here, the modality of the achievement of objectives remains in the hands of the given addressees. This implies a shift from a top-down to a more collaborative, process-oriented form of decision-making. The approach has been successfully applied in two hazard cases and three administrative contexts: (a) the city of dortmund (germany) facing flash floods, (b) east attica region (greece) facing forest fires, and (c) lazio region (italy) also facing forest fires. As proved by the applications of the concept, a dialogue among experts, stakeholders, and decision-makers is indispensable in order to guarantee inclusion of all diverse and competing values, opinions, and claims.

This research discusses the importance of implementing a methodology for the prevention of flash floods, by comparing the methods applied since 2013 in the city of duque de caxias, in the baixada fluminense region of the state of rio de janeiro, brazil, and the major prevention actions suggested by the flash flood early warning system reference guide from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration, questioning civil defense professionals about the importance of each method to vulnerable communities. Even without the occurrence of an extreme event that proves the effectiveness of the method between 2014 and 2016, the population will certainly be better prepared to face the risks of disasters in the city in the future. In addition, the study also underscores an approach of approximation between academic studies and operational activities, which is still very incipient in brazil.",NATURAL HAZARDS; FLASH FLOODS; NON-STRUCTURAL MEASURES; CIVIL DEFENSE,RISK,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"AHNERT P, 2011, INT WORKSH EARL WARN.;ANGERHOFER G, 2011, INT WORKSH EARL WARN.;CALMANT S, 2009, OC SURF TOP SCI TEAM.;DANHELKA J, 2011, INT WORKSH EARL WARN.;FAISAL IM, 1999, URBAN WATER, V1, P145, DOI DOI 10.1016/S1462-0758(00)00004-2.;GERARD F, 2011, INT WORKSH EARL WARN.;HASSAN VV, 2017, YB I GEOSCIENCES UFR, V40, P127, DOI [10.11137/2017\_1\_127\_134, DOI 10.11137/2017\_1\_127\_134].;HSU WK, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V61, P1355, DOI 10.1007/S11069-011-0032-1.;LAWRENCE J, 2014, NAT HAZARDS, V74, P1773, DOI 10.1007/S11069-014-1288-Z.;LUZ BARCELLOS PC, 2016, BRAZ J METEOROL, V31, P319, DOI [10.1590/0102-778631320150146, DOI 10.1590/0102-778631320150146].;MIGUEZ MG, 2015, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V7, P11068, DOI 10.3390/SU70811068.;MORSS RE, 2016, J HYDROL, V541, P649, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2015.11.047.;MOURA CRW, 2013, BRAZ J METEOROL, V28, P267.;NCAR, 2010, FLASH FLOOD EARL WAR.;PIATYSZEK E, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V61, P1443, DOI 10.1007/S11069-011-0079-Z.;SHARMA U, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V60, P409, DOI 10.1007/S11069-011-0023-2.;SON CH, 2015, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V7, P16866, DOI 10.3390/SU71215851.;SUN DY, 2012, WATER-SUI, V4, P272, DOI 10.3390/W4010272.;TUCCI CEM, 2003, INUNDACOES URBANAS A, V1, P275.;YI LX, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V60, P295, DOI 10.1007/S11069-011-0011-6.","BARCELLOS, PDL (REPRINT AUTHOR), UFF, PASSO DA PATRIA ST 156,3 FLOOR,ROOM 365, BR-24210240 RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL.;LUZ BARCELLOS, PRISCILA DA CUNHA, CATALDI, MARCIO, PEREIRA SOARES, CARLOS ALBERTO, UFF, PASSO DA PATRIA ST 156,3 FLOOR,ROOM 365, BR-24210240 RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL.;DA COSTA, MARCELLO SILVA, SPECIAL SECRETARIAT CIVIL DEF \& SECUR POLICIES, DUQUE DE CAXIAS CITY HALL PMDC, GOVERNADOR ROBERTO SILVEIRA SQ 31,4 FLOOR, BR-25075005 RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL.",10.1007/S11069-017-2966-4,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",,,,0921-030X,1,313-330,SPRINGER,89,2017,ISI000409497100015,20,"GEOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",15,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",LUZ.PRISCILAGMAIL.COM CELSILVACOSTAGMAIL.COM MARCIO.CATALDIGMAIL.COM CARLOSSOARES.UFFGMAIL.COM,,FG0VD,,"BARCELLOS, PDL (REPRINT AUTHOR), UFF, PASSO DA PATRIA ST 156,3 FLOOR,ROOM 365, BR-24210240 RIO DE JANEIRO, BRAZIL",ISI,PRISCILA DA CUNHA,NOTREPORTED,,"LUZ BARCELLOS PC, 2017, NAT HAZARDS","LUZ BARCELLOS PC, 2017, NAT HAZARDS",FALSE,1,4_6,0,2,0,0,9,1,1
271,Voss M;Wagner K,Learning from (small) disasters,NATURAL HAZARDS,"In this article, disasters are understood as processes that have different impacts on social routines in terms of scale, scope and duration. The extent of adaptive processes in society can provide the ground for a rough classification of disaster types. Such classification has, on the one hand, practical and analytical advantages. On the other hand, they harbour the danger of overlooking transitions of scale and discourage comprehensive scale-related learning forms. Based on the disaster scale by fischer (int j mass emerg disasters 1:91-107, 2003), flash floods in mountain rivers and torrents are described as extreme emergencies or small-town disasters. Three given examples will clearly show that learning rarely takes place within an institutional setting that is subjected to small disasters, because the stakeholder's focus remains on only one level. Therefore, we propose to implement a system of self-organised and scale-independent learning, so called deutero learning, within the political subsystem. Following a damaging event, participative processes that involve all levels should be initialised. Their task would be to assess the combination of causes and draw conclusions for mitigation measures. An aggregation of these assessments would help the responsible political subsystems to adapt the current natural disasters policy to the changing environmental conditions.",SINGLE-LOOP LEARNING; DOUBLE-LOOP LEARNING; DEUTERO LEARNING; NATURAL HAZARDS; DISASTER; RESILIENCE,RESILIENCE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,26,"ADGER N, 2000, PROG HUM GEOGR, V3, P347.;ARGYRIS C., 1996, ORG LEARNING.;BATESON G., 1972, STEPS ECOLOGY MIND C.;BATESON G, 1983, OKOLOGIE GEISTES ANT.;BERKES F, 2007, NAT HAZARDS, V41, P283, DOI 10.1007/S11069-006-9036-7.;BIRKLAND THOMAS A, 2006, LESSONS DISASTER POL.;BROWN JS, 1991, ORGAN SCI, V2, P40, DOI 10.1287/ORSC.2.1.40.;DOMBROWSKY WR, 1996, KATASTROPHEN IHRE BE, P61.;DOMBROWSKY WR, 2004, KATASTROPHEN IHRE BE, P165.;FISCHER H.

With indiscriminate human encroachments, the impact of disasters such as rainfall-induced landslides, river/ coastal erosion, flash floods and cloud bursts is quite high. In order to minimise the harmful impact of these issues, there needs to be development of sustainable optimal solutions, which are best suited to the regions concerned, employment of new construction materials like geosynthetics and state-of-the-art techniques. As such, in dealing with such problems that have direct bearing on geoenvironment, an interdisciplinary approach needs to be developed, which is the starting point of environmental geotechnology as `applied science to research and resolve'. In view of this, this paper discusses a few key geoenvironmental engineering issues and challenges pertaining to the indian context.",GEOENVIRONMENT; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT; WASTE CONTAINMENT AND

433,Skias Sg,The effectiveness of engineering geology in coping with flash floods: a systems approach,COPING WITH FLASH FLOODS,"Flash floods are widely considered as very fast developing catastrophic floods resulting from short, intense rainfalls on steep topography. Their high-energy and mass transfer potential can be, through accelerated erosion mechanisms, the cause or trigger for the occurrence of other natural hazards such as shallow mass movement phenomena (slides, flows, falls etc.). As with most natural phenomena, flash floods need a systemic approach for effectively appreciating their dynamic properties including engaged external/internal factors that interact, and a rational assessment of their potential impacts. In planning a set of structural or non-structural measures for coping with flash floods in a particular case, there are some key knowledge points that can lead both to optimal selection (under the existing constraints), and realization of the mixture of measures. An overview of those key points related to the concept of a systemic approach and to appropriate engineering geological issues are presented.",,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,"CHORLEY R, 1971, PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY S.;PENNINGROWSELL EC, 1978, EFFECT WARNING FLOOD.;RAHN PH, 1991, HERITAGE ENG GEOLOGY, V3.;SMITH K, 1998, FLOODS PHYSICAL PROC.;YEVJEVICH V, 1994, NATO ADV SCI INST SE, V257, P573.","SKIAS, SG (REPRINT AUTHOR), DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE, DEPT CIVIL ENGN, XANTHI 67100, THRACE, GREECE.;DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE, DEPT CIVIL ENGN, XANTHI 67100, THRACE, GREECE.",,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","GRUNTFEST, E AND HANDMER, J",,0-7923-6825-8,,,115-122,SPRINGER,77,2001,ISI000168052200013,5,"ENGINEERING, GEOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",0,"ENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL, ENGINEERING, GEOLOGICAL, GEOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",SKIASRODOPI.CC.DUTH.GR,"NATO SCIENCE SERIES, PARTNERSHIP SUB-SERIES 2: ENVIRONMENTAL SECURITY",BR92W,COPING WITH FLASH FLOODS,"SKIAS, SG (REPRINT AUTHOR), DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE, DEPT CIVIL ENGN, XANTHI 67100, THRACE, GREECE",ISI,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,DEMOCRITUS UNIV THRACE,,"SKIAS SG, 2001, COPING WITH FLASH FLOODS","SKIAS SG, 2001, COPING WITH FLASH FLOODS",FALSE,1_2,4_6,0,0,0,0,9,0,2

Flood insurance has attracted more and more attention in recent years, not only in the fields of science and politics but also within the insurance industry itself. Although the list of great natural disasters is headed by storms, and despite the relatively low density of insurance against flooding, the large number of local flood events constitutes a large interest for the insurance industry. Flooding comes in various forms, ranging from storm surges to flash floods and from sometimes country-wide river floods to glacial lake outburst and dam break floods. These different forms of flooding are important when it comes to insurance concepts, for which adverse selection plays an important role. Various concepts for the field of flood insurance have been investigated and discussed in different countries. In germany, the insurance industry, in a combined effort, has launched a project to identify zones of similar risk resulting from river floods for the whole country. The identification of possible clients and the calculation of premiums are two uses of the developed model, as well as the assessment of probable maximum losses. Only river floods are considered in the model, flash floods and storm surges are excluded, flood control measures are not taken into account either.",,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,"BERZ G, 1999, 28 IAHR C GRAZ AUG 2.;KLEEBERG HB, 1998, GEOINFOSYSTEM UBERSC.;KRON W, 2000, IN PRESS P WORLD C E.;KRON W., 1999, TOPICS 2000 NATURAL, P82.;KRON W, 1999, P EUR EXP M OD FLOOD, P135.;KRON W, 2000, P CALAR C LIV NAT HA.;MUNICH R., 1997, FLOODING INSURANCE.;MUNICH RE, 1999, TOPICS 2000 NATURAL.","MUNICH RE GRP, MUNICH, GERMANY.",,"EUROPAISCHER VERLAG WISSENSCH POSTFACH 940225, 60460 FRANKFURT, GERMANY","KING, L AND METZLER, M AND JIANG, T",,3-631-38119-0,1615-312X,,49-68,PETER LANG GMBH,2,2001,ISI000179594400004,8,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, GEOGRAPHY, WATER RESOURCES",0,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, GEOGRAPHY, WATER RESOURCES",,SCHRIFTEN ZUR INTERNATIONALEN ENTWICKLUNGS- UND UMWELTFORSCHUNG,BV63P,"FLOOD RISKS AND LAND USE CONFLICTS IN THE YANGTZE CATCHMENT, CHINA AND AT THE RHINE RIVER, GERMANY: STRATEGIES FOR A SUSTAINABLE FLOOD MANAGEMENT","MUNICH RE GRP, MUNICH, GERMANY",ISI,,NOTREPORTED,,"KRON W, 2001, FLOOD RISKS AND LAND USE CONFLICTS IN THE YANGTZE CATCHMENT, CHINA AND AT THE RHINE RIVER, GERMANY: STRATEGIES FOR A SUSTAINABLE FLOOD MANAGEMENT","KRON W, 2001, FLOOD RISKS AND LAND USE CONFLICTS IN THE YANGTZE CATCHMENT, CHINA AND AT THE RHINE RIVER, GERMANY: STRATEGIES FOR A SUSTAINABLE FLOOD MANAGEMENT",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0,2,10,0,2_3_8

But, despite many studies, local and national authorities still struggle to issue good flash floods warnings. We will argue that this failure results from a classical approach of warnings, based on a strict separation between the assessment world and the action world. We will go further than the previous criticisms (pielke and carbone, 2002) and show that forecasters, decision makers, emergency services and local population have quite similar practices during a flash-flood warning.

This resulted in abnormal torrential rains, the most destructive being the mid-November ones. Many human deaths were reported, and thousands were displaced by landslides in the mountainous and hilly areas. A lot of livestock and personal belongings also perished. More flooding increased the risk to the Cholera epidemic. The havoc done to infrastructures such as roads, bridges, schools, and health units as well as peoples’ houses, was placed at billions of Uganda shillings. Hundreds of acres of food and cash crops were destroyed by floods and land slides, leading to an increase in social, economic, and environmental vulnerability.

486,Borga M;Comiti F;Ruin I;Marra F,Forensic analysis of flash flood response,WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER,"The last decade has witnessed the development of methodologies for the post-flood documentation of both hydrogeomorphological and social response to extreme precipitation. These investigations are particularly interesting for the case of flash floods, whose space-time scales make their observations by conventional hydrometeorological monitoring networks particularly challenging. Effective flash flood documentation requires post-flood survey strategies encompassing accurate radar estimation of rainfall, field and remote-sensing observations of the geomorphic processes, indirect reconstruction of peak discharges-as well eyewitness interviews. These latter can give valuable information on both flood dynamics and the related individual and collective responses. This study describes methods for post-flood surveys based on interdisciplinary collaborations between natural and social scientists. These surveys may help to better understand the links between hydrometeorological dynamics and geomorphic processes as well as the relationship between flood dynamics and behavioral response in the context of fast space-time changes of flooding conditions.

Preparedness and response measures need to concentrate on toxicological and infectious hazards, the potential impact on environmental health, and threat to human lives. The recognition of the danger of flood water after hurricanes is critical. Effective health management needs to consider the likelihood and specific risks of toxic agents present in waters contaminated by chemical spills, bio-toxins, waste, sewage, and water-borne pathogens. Despite significant progress in the ability to rapidly detect and test water for a wide range of chemicals and pathogens, there has been a lack of implementation to adapt toxicity measurements in the context of flash and hurricane-induced flooding. The aim of this review was to highlight the need to collect and analyze data on toxicity of flood waters to understand the risks and prepare vulnerable communities and first responders. It is proposed that new and routinely used technologies be employed during disaster response to rapidly assess toxicity and infectious disease threats, and subsequently take necessary remedial actions.",TOXICOLOGY; ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH; HURRICANES; CYCLONES; CLIMATE CHANGE,CLIMATE-CHANGE; NATURAL DISASTERS; WEATHER EVENTS; NEW-ORLEANS; WATER; EXPOSURES; LEPTOSPIROSIS; HAZARDS; MESOTHELIOMA; TRANSMISSION,ENGLISH,REVIEW,ARTICLE,0,none,"ERICKSON, TB (REPRINT AUTHOR), HARVARD MED SCH, BRIGHAM \& WOMENS HOSP, DEPT EMERGENCY MED, DIV MED TOXICOL, 10 VINING ST NEVILLE HOUSE, BOSTON, MA 02115 USA.;ERICKSON, TIMOTHY B., BROOKS, JULIA, NILLES, ERIC J., PHAM, PHUONG N., VINCK, PATRICK, HARVARD MED SCH, BRIGHAM \& WOMENS HOSP, DEPT EMERGENCY MED, HARVARD HUMANITARIAN INITIAT, BOSTON, MA 02115 USA.",10.1080/10937404.2019.1654422,"530 WALNUT STREET, STE 850, PHILADELPHIA, PA 19106 USA",,,,1093-7404,56,157-171,TAYLOR \& FRANCIS INC,22,2019,ISI000483121000001,95,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, PUBLIC, ENVIRONMENTAL \& OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, TOXICOLOGY",30,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, PUBLIC, ENVIRONMENTAL \& OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, TOXICOLOGY",TERICKSONBWH.HARVARD.EDU,,IZ7HD,,"ERICKSON, TB (REPRINT AUTHOR), HARVARD MED SCH, BRIGHAM \& WOMENS HOSP, DEPT EMERGENCY MED, DIV MED TOXICOL, 10 VINING ST NEVILLE HOUSE, BOSTON, MA 02115 USA",ISI,HARVARD MED SCH,HARVARD MED SCH,,"ERICKSON TB, 2019, J TOXICOL ENV HEALTH-PT B-CRIT REV","ERICKSON TB, 2019, J TOXICOL ENV HEALTH-PT B-CRIT REV",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0,3,10,1,1

It is, therefore, obvious that an analysis and quantification of vulnerability is required for successful disaster risk reduction. The need for vulnerability assessment is crucial due to the effects of climate change as well as the socio-economic dynamics that may directly impact vulnerabilities and coping capacities of affected communities. Vulnerability is multidimensional (physical, social, economic, etc.), however, the dimension which is mainly related to the direct costs and threat to human lives is the physical one. We focus here on the physical vulnerability of buildings subject to torrential hazards occurring in small and steep mountain catchments. These processes include fluvial sediment transport, debris floods, and debris flows. Furthermore, we included flash flood hazards if these are related to torrential catchments. Physical vulnerability to torrential hazards in mountain areas is a topic that has been under scientific investigation over the last 20 years. Several methods to assess physical vulnerability of buildings towards flash floods, debris flows and hyper-concentrated flows can be found in the literature. The plethora of methods and approaches may be classified under the following three categories: vulnerability matrices, vulnerability curves and vulnerability indices. We provide a short review of these methods which became available over the last decade and which dominate the scientific debate in mountain hazard risk management, giving an emphasis to vulnerability curves. The approaches presented herein are highlighted through case studies from the european alps and beyond. Furthermore, challenges in vulnerability assessment including data requirements, need for improved event documentation, uncertainties and challenges related to future climate and socio-economic changes are outlined. Finally, a discussion on progress-driving factors such as new technologies (e.g. Mobile apps, drones), citizen science and new innovative assessment methods is provided.",VULNERABILITY; EXPOSURE; TORRENTIAL HAZARDS; DEGREE OF LOSS; BUILDINGS; REVIEW,ASSESSING PHYSICAL VULNERABILITY; DISASTER RISK REDUCTION; FLASH FLOODS; BUILDING VULNERABILITY; GEOMORPHIC HAZARDS; MOUNTAIN HAZARDS; DEBRIS; MODEL; SUSCEPTIBILITY; RESILIENCE,ENGLISH,REVIEW,ARTICLE,1,none,"FUCHS, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV NAT RESOURCES \& LIFE SCI, INST MT RISK ENGN, VIENNA, AUSTRIA.;FUCHS, S., PAPATHOMA-KOEHLE, M., UNIV NAT RESOURCES \& LIFE SCI, INST MT RISK ENGN, VIENNA, AUSTRIA.;KEILER, M., UNIV BERN, INST GEOG, BERN, SWITZERLAND.;KEILER, M., UNIV BERN, MOBILIAR LAB NAT RISKS, OESCHGER CTR CLIMATE CHANGE RES, BERN, SWITZERLAND.;ORTLEPP, R., SCHINKE, R., LEIBNIZ INST ECOL URBAN \& REG DEV, DRESDEN, GERMANY.",10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2019.05.067,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,"AUSTRIAN SCIENCE FUND (FWF)AUSTRIAN SCIENCE FUND (FWF) [V-519-N29, P27400-NBL]; SWISS NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (SNSF)SWISS NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (SNSF) [159899]",,0022-1694,,587-595,ELSEVIER,575,2019,ISI000488143000046,84,"ENGINEERING, GEOLOGY, WATER RESOURCES",20,"ENGINEERING, CIVIL, GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, WATER RESOURCES",,,JA9AS,,"FUCHS, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV NAT RESOURCES \& LIFE SCI, INST MT RISK ENGN, VIENNA, AUSTRIA",ISI,UNIV NAT RESOURCES AND LIFE SCI;UNIV BERN;UNIV BERN;SCHINKE,UNIV NAT RESOURCES AND LIFE SCI,,"FUCHS S, 2019, J HYDROL","FUCHS S, 2019, J HYDROL",FALSE,1,1,2,0,0,2_6,10,0,5

One of the most notable consequences of climate change in the iberian peninsula is hooding, the frequency and social and economic impact of which have increased in recent decades. As a result, a change of paradigm in flood risk management has been identified, with the social dimension of the disasters acquiring more importance. This paper presents a review of the theoretical and empirical approaches in relation to flood risk, emphasizing the contributions made in the field of environmental psychology.

The results showed that the use of fuelwood and competition for agriculture land are the main causes of deforestation, which leads to increased soil erosion and floods. The consequences and the societal risks from floods are quantified. This study indicates that the numbers of fatalities and mortality per river flood event are lower compared with those caused by flash floods.

In the recent decade extreme precipitation events have led to numerous flash floods in and around the himalayan region. Sporadic case-based studies have tried to explain the mechanisms causing the floods. However, in some of the cases, the causative mechanisms have been elusive. Various types of flood events have been debated at different spatial and temporal scales. The present study provides an overview of mechanisms that lead to floods in and around the southern rim of the indian himalayas.

Inexorably, our exposure to this hazard is going up
worldwide. The challenge is to manage the resulting vulnerability. Given the characteristics of flash flooding there is little choice but to focus on warning systems and emergency response, recovery, and compensation.
This chapter identifies issues, needs, and constraints - as well as the major challenges in improving warning systems. These are drawn from the views of participants in the NATO-Advanced Study Institute reported in this volume. To locate gaps needing research attention, we then summarize existing knowledge for flash flood warnings based on experience and the research literature. In doing so we acknowledge that any such summary will be general and partial. A critical aspect of gap filling is
 being able to assess whether warnings are getting better or worse, and part of the chapter analyzes the current approach to assessment. The conclusion looks forward, identifying areas that need the most urgent attention and for which the payoff appears
greatest. Much of the chapter is based on work and experience from the United States - this reflects the relatively large effort that country has devoted to the topic.

For the last half of the 20`h century, the warning program has used a flash flood watch/warning system similar to the tornado and severe thunderstorm watch/warning system. In this system, a watch is posted several hours in advance of an approaching weather system that is expected to cause the weather hazard. When the hazard begins or is about to begin, a warning is issued to alert the general population that action is now required to protect life and property [I]. This system was established during an era when communications and computer systems were in their infancy.

We conducted a systematic pubmed search to identify studies examining risk factors for health effects of precipitation-related floods, among organisation for economic co-operation and development (oecd) member countries. Research identifying flood-related morbidity and mortality risk factors is limited and primarily examines demographic characteristics such as age and gender. During floods, females, elderly and children appear to be at greater risk of psychological and physical health effects, while males between 10 to 29 years may be at greater risk of mortality. Post-flood, those over 65 years and males are at increased risk of physical health effects, while females appear at greater risk of psychological health effects. Other risk factors include previous flood experiences, greater flood depth or flood trauma, existing illnesses, medication interruption, and low education or socio-economic status. Tailoring messages to high-risk groups may increase their effectiveness. Target populations differ for morbidity and mortality effects, and differ pre-, during, and post-flood. Additional research is required to identify the risk factors associated with pre- and post-flood mortality and post-flood morbidity, preferably using prospective cohort studies.",VULNERABILITY; FLOODS; RISK FACTORS; HUMANS; HEALTH,UNITED-STATES; NATURAL DISASTERS; WATERBORNE DISEASE; WEATHER EVENTS; FLASH FLOODS; RISK; DEATHS; BANGLADESH; FATALITIES; SYMPTOMS,ENGLISH,REVIEW,ARTICLE,38,"ADELEKAN IO, 2011, NAT HAZARDS, V56, P215, DOI 10.1007/S11069-010-9564-Z.;AHERN M, 2005, EPIDEMIOL REV, V27, P36, DOI 10.1093/EPIREV/MXI004.;[ANONYMOUS], 2013, FLOODS WHO EUR REG H.;[ANONYMOUS], 2010, GUID WAT SUPPL SAN E.;ARAGON-DURAND F, 2007, DISASTERS, V31, P477, DOI 10.1111/J.0361-3666.2007.01020.X.;ASHLEY ST, 2008, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V47, P805, DOI 10.1175/2007JAMC1611.1.;BANKOFF G, 2003, DISASTERS, V27, P224, DOI 10.1111/1467-7717.00230.;BECKER G., 2013, J FLOOD RISK MANAGE, DOI 10.1111/JFR3.12025.;BENNET G, 1970, BRIT MED J, V3, P454, DOI 10.1136/BMJ.3.5720.454.;BHARDWAJ P., 2008, J MED SCI, V62, P431, DOI 10.4103/0019-5359.48454.;BROUWER R, 2007, RISK ANAL, V27, P313, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.2007.00884.X.;BUBECK P, 2012, RISK ANAL, V32, P1481, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.2011.01783.X.;CANINO G, 1990, INT J MENT HEALTH, V19, P51, DOI 10.1080/00207411.1990.11449153.;CANN KF, 2013, EPIDEMIOL INFECT, V141, P671, DOI 10.1017/S0950268812001653.;CASTONGUAY S, 2007, ENVIRON HIST, V12, P820, DOI 10.1093/ENVHIS/12.4.820.;*CCDR, 2000, CAN COMMUN DIS REP, V26, P170.","LOWE, D (REPRINT AUTHOR), UMEA UNIV, DEPT PUBL HLTH \& CLIN MED OCCUPAT \& ENVIRONM MED, SE-90187 UMEA, SWEDEN.;LOWE, DIANNE, EBI, KRISTIE L., FORSBERG, BERTIL, UMEA UNIV, DEPT PUBL HLTH \& CLIN MED OCCUPAT \& ENVIRONM MED, SE-90187 UMEA, SWEDEN.;LOWE, DIANNE, LA TROBE UNIV, SCH PUBL HLTH \& HUMAN BIOSCI, CTR HLTH COMMUN \& PARTICIPAT, BUNDOORA, VIC 3086, AUSTRALIA.",10.3390/IJERPH10127015,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,EUROPEAN UNIONEUROPEAN UNION (EU),,1660-4601,12,7015-7067,MDPI AG,10,2013,ISI000330219600044,81,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, PUBLIC, ENVIRONMENTAL \& OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH",34,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, PUBLIC, ENVIRONMENTAL \& OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH",D.LOWELATROBE.EDU.AU KRISEBIESSLLC.ORG BERTIL.FORSBERGENVMED.UMU.SE,,296XV,,"LOWE, D (REPRINT AUTHOR), UMEA UNIV, DEPT PUBL HLTH \& CLIN MED OCCUPAT \& ENVIRONM MED, SE-90187 UMEA, SWEDEN",ISI,UMEA UNIV;LA TROBE UNIV,UMEA UNIV,,"LOWE D, 2013, INT J ENVIRON RES PUBLIC HEALTH","LOWE D, 2013, INT J ENVIRON RES PUBLIC HEALTH",FALSE,0,5,2,0,0,1_3_4,10,0,1

The review focused on people's voluntary entry of floodwater. From the literature, five predominant reasons for entering floodwater were identified, including undertaking a recreational activity, attempting to reach a destination, retrieving property, livestock, or pets, undertaking employment duties, and rescuing or assisting with evacuation. Two primary influences on entering floodwater were found, namely risk perception (i.e., being unaware of or underestimating the risk from flooding) and social influences (i.e., being influenced by others). Demographics and environmental and temporal factors also played a part in decision-making about whether to enter floodwater or not. Emergency managers should take account of such factors when devising future public education strategies. Further research, including comparisons with current theoretical models, could help identify additional influences on decision-making for floodwater entry.",APPLICATIONS; EDUCATION; EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS; EMERGENCY RESPONSE; FLOOD EVENTS,FLASH-FLOOD; FATALITIES; DISASTER; RISK; HAZARD; LIFE; PERCEPTIONS; AUSTRALIA; FRANCE; SAFETY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,13,"AGUIRRE B.

High levels of urbanisation have made much of the urban areas highly impermeable. This has made urban areas more vulnerable to water-related disasters. At the same time, the overall occurrence rate of climatic induced water-related disasters in gujarat has increased. Recent flash floods have shown their adverse impact on urban areas and the existing management of the water supply is inefficient and unable to cope with the high risk of water-related disasters. Often, it is the poorest city dwellers who are most affected by this mismanagement. The current disaster management plan is inadequate and does not consider proactive risk reduction strategies. This paper has assessed the risk and vulnerability aspects of urban disasters in gujarat and has proposes more concrete strategies. There is a need to have strong disaster management strategies which not only reduce the risk due to water-related disasters, but also augment access to sage, urban water resources for all urban dwellers.",GUJARAT; FLOOD; RISK MANAGEMENT; URBAN DISASTER MANAGEMENT; URBAN VULNERABILITY,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,1,"*CMAG, 2003, BEST PRACT CAT 2002.",,,"6000 BROKEN SOUND PARKWAY NW, STE 300, BOCA RATON, FL 33487-2742 USA","FEYEN, J AND SHANNON, K AND NEVILLE, M",,978-0-415-48334-6,,,323+,CRC PRESS-TAYLOR \& FRANCIS GROUP,,2009,ISI000268662600040,6,ENGINEERING,0,"ENGINEERING, CIVIL",,,BKN19,"WATER AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PARADIGMS: TOWARDS AN INTEGRATION OF ENGINEERING, DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT APPROACHES",,ISI,,NOTREPORTED,,"LODHIA S, 2009, WATER AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PARADIGMS: TOWARDS AN INTEGRATION OF ENGINEERING, DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT APPROACHES","LODHIA S, 2009, WATER AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT PARADIGMS: TOWARDS AN INTEGRATION OF ENGINEERING, DESIGN AND MANAGEMENT APPROACHES",FALSE,1,6,1,0,0,0,10,1,1
275,Imran Hm;Akib S;Karim Mr,Permeable pavement and stormwater management systems: a review,ENVIRONMENTAL TECHNOLOGY,"Uncontrolled stormwater runoff not only creates drainage problems and flash floods but also presents a considerable threat to water quality and the environment. These problems can, to a large extent, be reduced by a type of stormwater management approach employing permeable pavement systems (pps) in urban, industrial and commercial areas, where frequent problems are caused by intense undrained stormwater. Pps could be an efficient solution for sustainable drainage systems, and control water security as well as renewable energy in certain cases. Considerable research has been conducted on the function of pps and their improvement to ensure sustainable drainage systems and water quality. This paper presents a review of the use of permeable pavement for different purposes. The paper focuses on drainage systems and stormwater runoff quality from roads, driveways, rooftops and parking lots. Pps are very effective for stormwater management and water reuse.

442,Ganoulis J,A hydro-social modeling approach for flash flooding alleviation,COPING WITH FLASH FLOODS,"Extreme floods are essentially natural hazards that occur at a relatively low frequency. Excessive precipitation is, in most cases, the main cause of catastrophic floods. However, anthropogenic factors, such as human occupation of floodways, extensive urbanization, and structural measures to mitigate floods (flood levees and walls, cutting of the river meanders, river training) have modified the natural characteristics of extreme floods [14,18]. Recent catastrophic flood events both in Europe and the USA have shown that human activities and traditional river engineering works may result in an increase in the frequency of extreme floods, of the water stage and, most importantly, of negative economic consequences such as loss of property and human life.

The practice of water sensitive urban design (wsud) has emerged along with a number of other approaches to mitigate risks such as flash flooding, pollution of fresh and marine receiving waters, and water scarcity. The drivers for adopting wsud practices, and the approaches used, depend on the specific context. Practices have continued to evolve and be refined, which has in large part been due to lessons learnt from pioneering developments that trialled innovative wsud approaches. The cases reviewed in this chapter discuss some examples of leading-edge wsud approaches that have provided the practical demonstration of the challenges and benefits to implementing wsud. They can be used not only to refine standards and guidelines but also to build confidence in the wsud approaches. A synthesis of findings from the case studies revealed the importance of wsud being integrated across different urban functions, stakeholders, and levels of government. It is also shown that the benefits of wsud often extend beyond the primary objective of improved urban stormwater management, reflecting the multifunctional nature of many wsud approaches. These co-benefits often help to build public understanding and engagement in the benefits of wsud. The cases also identified the importance of using economic instruments that reflect the true cost of different stormwater management approaches, which in turn can create the financial incentives for the adoption of wsud approaches.",INTEGRATED URBAN WATER MANAGEMENT; LOW IMPACT URBAN DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN; WATER SENSITIVE URBAN DESIGN,URBAN STORMWATER MANAGEMENT; RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT; DESIGN; IMPEDIMENTS; IMPACT,ENGLISH,"ARTICLE, BOOK CHAPTER",INCOLLECTION,0,none,"COOK, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), CSIRO LAND \& WATER, CLAYTON, VIC, AUSTRALIA.;COOK, STEPHEN, CSIRO LAND \& WATER, CLAYTON, VIC, AUSTRALIA.;VAN ROON, MARJORIE, UNIV AUCKLAND, AUCKLAND, NEW ZEALAND.;EHRENFRIED, LISA, YARRA VALLEY WATER, MITCHAM, VIC, AUSTRALIA.;LAGRO, JAMES, JR., UNIV WISCONSIN MADISON, MADISON, WI USA.;YU, QIAN, CHINA INST WATER RESOURCES \& HYDROPOWER RES, BEIJING, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.1016/B978-0-12-812843-5.00027-7,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","SHARMA, AK AND GARDNER, T AND BEGBIE, D",,"978-0-12-812844-2, 978-0-12-812843-5",,,561-585,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,,2019,ISI000470065000029,71,"ENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, URBAN STUDIES, WATER RESOURCES",1,"ENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL, ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, URBAN STUDIES, WATER RESOURCES",,,BM8XK,"APPROACHES TO WATER SENSITIVE URBAN DESIGN: POTENTIAL, DESIGN, ECOLOGICAL HEALTH, URBAN GREENING, ECONOMICS, POLICIES, AND COMMUNITY PERCEPTIONS","COOK, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), CSIRO LAND \& WATER, CLAYTON, VIC, AUSTRALIA",ISI,UNIV AUCKLAND;UNIV WISCONSIN MADISON;CHINA INST WATER RESOURCES AND HYDROPOWER RES,NOTREPORTED,,"COOK S, 2019, APPROACHES TO WATER SENSITIVE URBAN DESIGN: POTENTIAL, DESIGN, ECOLOGICAL HEALTH, URBAN GREENING, ECONOMICS, POLICIES, AND COMMUNITY PERCEPTIONS","COOK S, 2019, APPROACHES TO WATER SENSITIVE URBAN DESIGN: POTENTIAL, DESIGN, ECOLOGICAL HEALTH, URBAN GREENING, ECONOMICS, POLICIES, AND COMMUNITY PERCEPTIONS",FALSE,0,6,0,0,0,0,10,1,1
7,Ahmed Ma;Haynes K;Taylor M,"Driving into floodwater: a systematic review of risks, behaviour and mitigation",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,"This systematic review summarises the findings of research focused on the risks associated with driving into floodwater. The review aims to compare and document the magnitude of the problem internationally, identifying the risk factors, exploring the application of theories and presence of theoretical models to explain people's risky behaviour, and documenting the intervention strategies utilised or proposed. Literature were searched from a number of databases (e.g. Psycinfo, sciencedirect, informit) for publication dates to 31 august 2017, then assessed based on their titles, abstracts and full texts and finally 24 articles were selected. This review compares flood fatality data from four countries (australia, united states, greece, and sweden), groups identified risk factors from these selected studies into seven categories, and proposes a holistic integrated intervention model. The results of the review indicate that studies were predominantly conducted in australia (10 studies) and usa (7 studies). People's decisions to drive into, or turn back from, floodwater are identified as a consequence of both their risk perception and the combined impact of all other factors (e.g. Individual, social, environmental etc.) That interdependently contribute to shape decision-making, the theory of planned behaviour (tpb) was the only theory that has been utilised within the literature to understand drivers' willingness to take risks. Improving people's decision-making through educational initiatives, advanced structural mechanisms, regulating existing edicts, and regularly evaluating the effectiveness of current strategies are identified as the best approaches to addressing the challenges in this area. Findings suggest that future studies require data and analysis from a larger range of countries, more comparative analyses within and between countries, an exploration of the relationship between risk factors and their relative level of influence and a greater application of behavioural and decision making theories.",FLOOD; VEHICLES; DRIVING; DROWNING; FATALITIES; RISK FACTORS; RISK PERCEPTION; BEHAVIOURAL THEORIES; RISK MITIGATION MEASURES,PROTECTION MOTIVATION THEORY; PLANNED BEHAVIOR; SPEED LIMITS; FLOODED WATERWAYS; FLASH FLOODS; FATALITIES; BELIEFS; DRIVERS; INTENTIONS; PREDICTION,ENGLISH,REVIEW,ARTICLE,0,"AJZEN I, 1991, ORGAN BEHAV HUM DEC, V50, P179, DOI 10.1016/0749-5978(91)90020-T.;AJZEN I, 1986, J EXP SOC PSYCHOL, V22, P453, DOI 10.1016/0022-1031(86)90045-4.;ARRIGHI C, 2015, J FLUID STRUCT, V57, P170, DOI 10.1016/J.JFLUIDSTRUCTS.2015.06.010.;ASHLEY S., 2008, FLOOD FATAL U S, V47.;BECKER JS, 2015, WEATHER CLIM SOC, V7, P321, DOI 10.1175/WCAS-D-14-00030.1.;BERZ G, 2001, NAT HAZARDS, V23, P443, DOI 10.1023/A:1011193724026.;COATES L, 1999, AUST GEOGR, V30, P391, DOI 10.1080/00049189993657.;CONNER M, 1998, J APPL SOC PSYCHOL, V28, P1429, DOI 10.1111/J.1559-1816.1998.TB01685.X.;DIAKAKIS M., 2015, J FLOOD RISK MANAG, DOI [10.1111/JFR3.12166, DOI 10.1111/JFR3.12166].;DIAKAKIS M, 2016, ENVIRON HAZARDS-UK, V15, P148, DOI 10.1080/17477891.2016.1147412.;DIAKAKIS M, 2013, ENVIRON HAZARDS-UK, V12, P278, DOI 10.1080/17477891.2013.832651.;DROBOT S.

Among those events are tsunamis, storm surges, river floods, flash floods, mass movements and droughts. The driving factors of this risk are the unabated increase in global population, the concentration of people in high-risk areas such as coasts, flood plains and hillsides, the rise in vulnerability of assets, infrastructure and social systems, and the consequences of environmental and climatic changes. Risk reduction requires general awareness at all levels of society and a partnership between the public sector, the people concerned and the insurance industry. Structural and nonstructural precautionary measures are always cheaper in the long run than paying losses.

Flood and flash flood events affected many places adversely and caused serious human and material losses in turkey. The search for a solution related to this problematic issue has become the starting point of the research. Noteworthy factors that increase the risk of flooding in turkey include the effects of global climate change, increasing number of urban areas, changes in landscape, wrong land use decisions, spatial planning approaches disregarding natural thresholds and the phenomenon of natural risk. In this context, spatial planning approaches are needed to reinforce settlements against flooding disasters and ensure sustainability. In this study, international conferences and approaches of developed countries (united states, european union and switzerland) to reducing flood risk were investigated. In this context, this study describes existing legal-administrative structures and practices for the solution of problems caused by floods in turkey and examines their relationship with spatial planning studies. The objective of this study is to demonstrate that the key to success in all efforts to prevent damages to property caused by floods in turkey is ``the need for ensuring integration of such efforts with spatial planning decisions at all scales, by comparing exemplary practices in developed countries to those in turkey.

It is expected that the global atmosphere and ocean is increasingly getting warmer, the amount of ice on the earth is decreasing over the oceans, and the sea level has risen. According to intergovernmental panel on climate change, such temperature change is around 0.78 degrees c over decades. Without international collaboration towards paris agreement, the temperature change could potentially rise over 5.5 degrees c in 2100. In addition, it is highly likely that even such a small change can trigger the worst of other extreme natural threats to interdependent urban and transport infrastructure systems. The vulnerability of those infrastructure systems has not been comprehensively addressed in open literature due to the fact that the actual climate change impact depends on specific differences of local environmental and geographical conditions. As a result, our research will highlight the extremes that can lead to system failure, degraded operation and ultimately, delays to train services. The emphasis is placed on the newly proposed malaysia-singapore high speed rail network, which can be affected by the most-frequent severe weather conditions including heavy rainfall and flash flood. It is found that tunnelling, steep cutting and ballast foundation are ones of the most vulnerable assets from a heavy rainfall or a flash flood.",RAILWAY INFRASTRUCTURE; HIGH SPEED RAIL; TRACKS; RISK; MANAGEMENT AND MONITORING; CLIMATE CHANGE; GLOBAL WARMING; ADAPTATION; OPERATIONAL READINESS; HEAVY RAIN; FLOOD,CLIMATE-CHANGE; NOISE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,5,"AHMAD RADZI A., 2013, INT C EM TRENDS ENG.;[ANONYMOUS], 2013, NEWS STRAITS TIMES.;[ANONYMOUS], 2015, THESUNDAILY.;BADRUL HISHAM A., 2009, MALAYSIAN J COMMUNIT, V15, P1.;BINTI SA'ADIN S.L., 2016, INGENIEUR, V66, P44.;BRIGINSHAW D., 2014, SHINKANSEN HALF CENT.;DE FREITAS RT, 2016, ENVIRONMENTS, V3, DOI 10.3390/ENVIRONMENTS3040034.;FREITAS M.

427,Pritchard F,Can understanding backwater effects help us to prepare for and manage deluges?,"MELTDOWN: CLIMATE CHANGE, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER CATASTROPHES - FEARS AND CONCERNS FOR THE FUTURE","One of the accepted scenarios of climate change is that we will experience more deluges, especially in areas that are subject to severe storms. Failure to prepare for, and adequately warn residents about, such rain events was evident in storm deluges in 2008/2009 in south-east queensland and mega floods in northern queensland which spread to cover over 70\% of the state with continued heavy rainfalls. The lack of adequate infrastructure to mitigate the effects of the precipitation reminds us how important it is to study previous events and to learn from them. One of the neglected areas of flash flooding and mega floods is that of backbuilding. South-east queensland has experienced flood events of differing magnitudes during many of the summer seasons in the past three decades, with the 1974 flood being the most significant. At the time of writing this chapter, because of the severe drought in australia in recent years, no further opportunities had arisen to update the information on flooding realities, although seq water has comparatively recently completed a \$70 million wivenhoe dam upgrade project which involved the construction of a 165-meter wide spillway and related works to mitigate a 1 in 100,000-year flood scenario.",GIS; DELUGES; FLOOD MODELLING; BACKWATER EFFECTS; CLIMATE CHANGE; QUEENSLAND,AMAZON RIVER FLOODPLAIN; INUNDATION AREA; RADAR; MODEL; GIS,ENGLISH,"ARTICLE, BOOK CHAPTER",INCOLLECTION,0,"ACKERMAN CT, 1999, HEC GEORAS LINKING G.;BATES PD, 2006, J HYDROL, V328, P306, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2005.12.028.;BATES PD, 2000, J HYDROL, V236, P54, DOI 10.1016/S0022-1694(00)00278-X.;BRAKENRIDGE GR, 1998, INT J REMOTE SENS, V19, P1439, DOI 10.1080/014311698215559.;CARPENTER TM, 1999, J HYDROL, V224, P21, DOI 10.1016/S0022-1694(99)00115-8.;CARSON EC, 2006, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V75, P368, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2005.07.022.;FEATHERSTONE R.

These risks will increase due to climate change and economic development. This requires a re-evaluation of coastal disaster risk reduction drr strategies and prevention, mitigation and preparedness pmp measures. To this end, the un office for disaster risk reduction formulated the hyogo framework for action, and the eu has issued the floods directive. By their nature, neither is specific about the methods to be used to assess coastal risks, particularly those risks resulting from dune and structure overtopping, the non-stationarity of surge and flash flood events, and coastal morphodynamic response. This paper describes a set of open-source and open-access methods, tools and management approaches to fill this gap. A coastal risk assessment framework will assess coastal risk at a regional scale. Thus critical hotspots can be identified for which an impact-oriented early warning system/decision support system is developed. This can be applied in dual mode: as a forecast and warning system and as an ex-ante planning tool to evaluate the vulnerability. The tools are demonstrated on case study sites on a range of eu coasts with diverse geomorphic settings, land use, forcing, hazard types and socio-economic, cultural and environmental characteristics. Specific drr plans will be developed for all sites. A management guide of pmp measures and management approaches is to be developed. The toolkit will benefit forecasting and civil protection agencies, coastal managers, local government, community members, ngos, the general public and scientists.",COASTAL RISK; IMPACTS; HAZARDS; EARLY-WARNING SYSTEMS; BAYESIAN MODELING; NUMERICAL MODELING; ECO-SYSTEMBASED APPROACHES; SOCIO-CULTURAL ASPECTS; IMPACT-ORIENTED DATA BASE,VULNERABILITY; STORMS,ENGLISH,"ARTICLE, PROCEEDINGS PAPER",ARTICLE,19,"ALFIERI L., 2011, ADV GEOSCI, V29, P69, DOI DOI 10.5194/ADGEO-29-69-2011.;BERENGUER M, 2011, J HYDROL, V404, P226, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2011.04.033.;BERTIN X, 2012, OCEAN MODEL, V42, P16, DOI 10.1016/J.OCEMOD.2011.11.001.;BIRKMANN J., 2006, MEASURING VULNERABIL.;BOSOM E, 2011, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V11, P475, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-11-475-2011.;CHECKLAND P, 2000, SYST RES BEHAV SCI, V17, PS11, DOI 10.1002/1099-1743(200011)17:1+<::AID-SRES374>3.0.CO,2-O.;DE VRIEND H.

139,Vinet F,From hazard reduction to integrated risk management: toward adaptive flood prevention in europe,"FLOOD RECOVERY, INNOVATION AND RESPONSE","Flood risk has long been seen only as a hydrological phenomenon. Flood risk management has therefore been directed almost exclusively toward curative methods. Dykes and dams have attempted to contain the floods while crisis management and insurance have compensated for loss. However, the acknowledgement of human responsibility in natural disasters has widened the epistemological field of natural-hazards knowledge integrating the concept of vulnerability. Recent and disastrous floods all over the world have highlighted the relative failure of the existing risk-management system. Over the past fifteen years, the increasing cost of damage has caused a reaction of the authorities, who have expressed through various laws and incentive measures their wish to develop integrated risk management. The integrated approach uses not only curative methods but also land-use planning, reduction of vulnerability and the development of public awareness by implementing local emergency plans. Through some examples in france, this presentation aims to suggest new ways of assessing risk-management measures. The french territory, located between northern and southern europe, is concerned by all kinds of floods: slow-rise floods in its northern part and flash floods in mountainous and mediterranean regions. For many years, the top-down institutional approach has led to the implementation of measures ill-adapted to mediterranean regions. Thus, this presentation shows how some measures, efficient for slow floods, are inefficient for mediterranean torrential floods. While the new european directive on flood risk is willing to reinforce flood prevention in europe, it is important to take into account the specific characteristics of each basin and each hydrological context before implementing flood-reduction measures such as upstream control, vulnerability reduction or flood warning. Stakeholders and institutions might implement an adaptive and territorial approach in flood prevention so as not to repeat the serious mistakes that we have seen for many years.",NATURAL HAZARDS; FLOODS; VULNERABILITY; MITIGATION; FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT; EUROPEAN DIRECTIVE; MEDITERRANEAN BASIN,FRANCE,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,5,"BELMONTE AMC, 2001, CATENA, V45, P229.;GAUME E, 2004, J HYDROL, V286, P135, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2003.09.015.;HEWITT K., 1983, INTERPRETATION CALAM.;HUTTER G, 2006, NATO SCI S SS IV EAR, V67, P229.;*MEDDCEMAGREF, 2004, RAL DYN PREV IN.","VINET, F., UNIV MONTPELLIER 3, DEPT GEOG, F-34032 MONTPELLIER, FRANCE.",10.2495/FRIAR080111,"ASHURST LODGE, SOUTHAMPTON SO40 7AA, ASHURST, ENGLAND","PROVERBS, D AND BREBBIA, CA AND PENNINGROWSELL, E",,978-1-84564-132-0,1743-3541,,113-122,WIT PRESS,118,2008,ISI000257926200011,10,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION",25,"ECOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, REGIONAL \& URBAN PLANNING",,WIT TRANSACTIONS ON ECOLOGY AND THE ENVIRONMENT,BIA45,"FLOOD RECOVERY, INNOVATION AND RESPONSE","VINET, F",ISI,,NOTREPORTED,,"VINET F, 2008, WIT TRANS ECOL ENVIRON","VINET F, 2008, WIT TRANS ECOL ENVIRON",FALSE,1,4_6,0,0,0,0,10,0,2
334,Shafique M;Kim R,"Recent progress in low-impact development in south korea: water-management policies, challenges and opportunities",WATER,"For the past few decades, rapid urban development and climate change has caused many meteorological disasters (flooding, droughts, and heat waves) in south korea. The current stormwater management system (gray infrastructure) is based on the pipe networks, which is not an effective method to control flash flooding problems during big rain events. Therefore, there is a need to find a more sustainable stormwater-management system that can have the ability to solve these water-related problems in urban areas. Low-impact development (lid)/green infrastructure (gi) practices are an effective approach to solving the adverse effects of urbanization and to addressing climate change. This paper reviews national water-management policies which were selected for flood and environmental protection from 1960 to 2017. Research results of applied lid practices in korea also show that these practices are useful for stormwater management in urban areas. The dominating challenges identified are: lack of proper knowledge for implementing lid practices, uncertainties in the benefits of lid/gi practices, and lack of cooperation and collaboration between different agencies for the expansion of lid projects. Finally, some opportunities for lid/gi practices in korea are also described.",LOW-IMPACT DEVELOPMENTS; GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE; STORMWATER MANAGEMENT; COOPERATION; COLLABORATION; FLASH FLOODING,URBAN; REDUCTION; RUNOFF; SEOUL; ROOF,ENGLISH,REVIEW,ARTICLE,4,"AHIABLAME LM, 2012, WATER AIR SOIL POLL, V223, P4253, DOI 10.1007/S11270-012-1189-2.;BARTON AB, 2007, AUSTRALAS J WAT RESO, V11, P31, DOI 10.1080/13241583.2007.11465309.;BERGMAN B, 2013, SUSTAINABLE WATER PR.;BOWMAN T, 2009, LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN, V92, P96, DOI 10.1016/J.LANDURBPLAN.2009.03.002.;BROWN R.R., 2008, P 11 INT C URB DRAIN.;CHAU H.

Twenty one national and eight regional geological surveys (gss) have participated in the analysis. The gss report almost 4000 recent (2015-2017) damaging landslides events resulting in 39 fatalities and 155 injuries, destruction to housing, infrastructure and properties. In addition, 11 countries report 18 morle events over the past 10 years responsible for 150 fatalities and severe economic impacts. Results also reveal almost 48 million people living in areas with high and very high degrees of landslide-susceptibility (around 1 million km(2) according to elsus v2). This work shows that almost half the participating countries (10 countries) have no legal guidance in the national land bill to stipulate consideration of landslides in urban planning practices, and mapping tools are often not adapted to a standard required to inform sustainable development. Furthermore, there is a wide range of laws and a large heterogeneity of mapping methods, scales and procedures. A relevant deficiency detected in many countries is the lack of landslide maps at a detailed resolution for urban planning. Additionally, some case studies of suboptimal urban development practices in areas of known instability have been discussed, they are found to be related to weak rule of law and/or absence of good governance. This paper shows inconsistencies across europe in the handling of landslides and proposes a series of key actions to improve this situation, highlighting the need for a common regulatory framework to deal with this geohazard appropriately.",LANDSLIDES; URBAN PLANNING; LEGISLATION; EUROGEOSURVEYS; EUROPE,FLASH-FLOODS; SUSCEPTIBILITY ASSESSMENT; RAINFALL; MANAGEMENT; INVENTORY; AREA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"MATEOS, RM (REPRINT AUTHOR), GEOL SURVEY SPAIN, DEPT NAT HAZARDS, CALLE RIOS ROSAS,23, MADRID 28003, SPAIN.;MATEOS, ROSA MARIA, LOPEZ-VINIELLES, JUAN, MAUTER, RIKE, SARRO, ROBERTO, BEJAR, MARTA, HERRERA, GERARDO, GEOL SURVEY SPAIN, DEPT NAT HAZARDS, CALLE RIOS ROSAS,23, MADRID 28003, SPAIN.;POYIADJI, ELEFTHERIA, TSAGKAS, DIMETRIOS, HELLEN SURVEY GEOL \& MINERAL EXPLORAT, 70 MESSOGHION STR, ATHENS 11527, GREECE.;SHEEHY, MICHAEL, GEOL SURVEY IRELAND, BEGGARS BUSH, HADDINGTON RD, DUBLIN D04 K7X4, IRELAND.;HADJICHARALAMBOUS, KLEOPAS, GEOL SURVEY CYPRUS, LEFKONOS 1, STROVOLOS, CYPRUS.;LISCAK, PAVEL, GEOL SURVEY SLOVAKIA, MLYNSKD DOLINA 3962-1, BRATISLAVA 81704, SLOVAKIA.;PODOLSKI, LASZLO, GEOL SURVEY CROATIA, UL MILANA SACHSA 2, ZAGREB 10000, CROATIA.;LASKOWICZ, IZABELA, GEOL SURVEY POLAND, RAKOWIECKA ST, PL-00975 WARSAW, POLAND.;IADANZA, CARLA, ISPRA, GEOL SURVEY ITALY, VIA VITALIANO BRANCATI 48, I-00144 ROME, ITALY.;GAUERT, CHRISTOPH, GEOL SURVEY SAXONY ANHALT HALLE, SAXONY ANHALT, GERMANY.;TODOROVIC, SASA, GEOL SURVEY SERBIA, KAMENICKA 6,P FAH 227, BELGRADE 11000, SERBIA.;AUFLIC, MATEJA JEMEC, GEOL SURVEY SLOVENIA, DIMDEVA ULICA 14, LJUBLJANA 1000, SLOVENIA.;MAFTEI, RALUCA, GEOL SURVEY ROMANIA CARANSEBES, CARANSEBES,1,SECT 1, BUCHAREST, ROMANIA.;HERMANNS, REGINALD L., GEOL SURVEY NORWAY, TRONDHEIM, NORWAY.;KOCIU, ARBEN, GEOL SURVEY AUSTRIA, NEULINGGASSE 38, A-1030 VIENNA, AUSTRIA.;SANDIC, CVJETKO, GEOL SURVEY REPUBL SRPSKA BOSNIA \& HERZEGOVINA, VUKA KARADILEA 148N, ZVOMIK 75400, BOSNIA \& HERCEG.",10.1016/J.LANDURBPLAN.2019.103740,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,"EUROPEAN COMMISSION, DIRECTORATE-GENERAL HUMANITARIAN AID AND CIVIL PROTECTION (ECHO), THROUGH THE PROJECT U-GEOHAZ: GEOHAZARD IMPACT ASSESSMENT FOR URBAN AREAS [783169]; SALVADOR DE MADARIAGA MOBILITY PROGRAM FROM THE SPANISH MINISTRY OF SCIENCE [PRX18/00020, PRX19/00065]",,0169-2046,,,ELSEVIER,196,2020,ISI000514248900007,48,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, GEOGRAPHY, PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY, PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, URBAN STUDIES",7,"ECOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, GEOGRAPHY, GEOGRAPHY, PHYSICAL, REGIONAL \& URBAN PLANNING, URBAN STUDIES",RM.MATEOSIGME.ES KYNPOIGME.GR GEOENVTEE.GR MICHAEL.SHEEHYGSI.IE KHADJICHARALAMBOUSGSD.MOA.GOV.CY PAVEL.LISCAKGEOLOGY.SK LPODOLSZKIHGI-CGS.HR ILASPGI.GOV.PL CARLA.IADANZAISPRAMBIENTE.IT GAUERTLAGB.MW.SACHSEN-ANHALT.DE SASA.TODOROVICGZS.GOV.RS MATEJA.JEMEC-AUFIICGEO-ZS.SI REGINALD.HERMANNSNGU.NO ARBEN.KOCIUGEOLOGIE.AC.AT C.SANDICGEOZAVODRS.COM RIKE.MAUTERSNAFU.DE R.SARROIGME.ES M.BEJARIGME.ES G.HERRERAIGME.ES,,KM6LF,,"MATEOS, RM (REPRINT AUTHOR), GEOL SURVEY SPAIN, DEPT NAT HAZARDS, CALLE RIOS ROSAS,23, MADRID 28003, SPAIN",ISI,NA,NOTREPORTED,,"MATEOS RM, 2020, LANDSC URBAN PLAN","MATEOS RM, 2020, LANDSC URBAN PLAN",FALSE,0,4_6,0,0,0,1_2,10,1,5

Flash floods and debris events have a long history in the island of madeira resulting in several adverse impacts on human health, the environment, cultural heritage and economic activity. For this reason and since the catastrophic debris event of 20 february 2010 the establishment of a flood risk management plan in the autonomous region of madeira (arm) has assumed double importance. The aim of the paper is to present flood risk analysis methods and technical options adopted in the elaboration of flood hazard and flood risk maps as well the flood risk management plan strategy. The hydrographic basin of socorridos is used as case study to show the principles and stages of the implementation of the flood risk directive (md) in the arm. In spite of some limitations associated with the volcanic mountain island characteristics and the debris events specificities, the flood risk analysis methods used are in harmony with the requirements of the mid. Another important issue is the flood risk management plan strategy that addresses all aspects of flood risk management.",FLOOD RISK DIRECTIVE; FLOOD HAZARD MAPS; FLOOD RISK MAPS; FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN; AUTONOMOUS REGION OF MADEIRA,OPPORTUNITIES; CHALLENGES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"MILEU, N (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV LISBON, INST GEOG \& ORDENAMENTO TERR, CTR ESTUDOS GEOG, RUA BRANCA EDMEE MARQUES, P-1600276 LISBON, PORTUGAL.;MILEU, NELSON, UNIV LISBON, INST GEOG \& ORDENAMENTO TERR, CTR ESTUDOS GEOG, RUA BRANCA EDMEE MARQUES, P-1600276 LISBON, PORTUGAL.;RODRIGUES, ANTONIO CARMONA, UNIV NOVA LISBOA, FAC CIENCIAS \& TECNOL, CAPARICA, PORTUGAL.;VALENTE, ADELAIDE, AGUA DIRECAO REG ORDENAMENTO TERR \& AMBIENTE, DIV RECURSOS HIDRICOS \& QUALIDADE, FUNCHAL, PORTUGAL.",10.18055/FINIS15157,"INST GEOGRAFIA \& ORDENAMENTO TERRITORIO IGOT, RUA BRANCA EDMEE MARQUES, LISBOA, 1600-276, PORTUGAL",,,,0430-5027,112,97-112,"UNIV LISBOA, CENTRO ESTUDOS GEOGRAFICOS",54,2019,ISI000503870900005,21,GEOGRAPHY,0,GEOGRAPHY,NMILEUCAMPUS.UL.PT ACRFCT.UNL.PT ADELAIDEVALENTEGOV-MADEIRA.PT,,JX6VV,,"MILEU, N (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV LISBON, INST GEOG \& ORDENAMENTO TERR, CTR ESTUDOS GEOG, RUA BRANCA EDMEE MARQUES, P-1600276 LISBON, PORTUGAL",ISI,UNIV LISBON;UNIV NOVA LISBOA,UNIV LISBON,,"MILEU N, 2019, FINISTERRA","MILEU N, 2019, FINISTERRA",FALSE,1,4_6,0,0,0,0,10,0,1
126,Karagiorgos K;Heiser M;Thaler T;Huebl J;Fuchs S,Micro-sized enterprises: vulnerability to flash floods,NATURAL HAZARDS,"In the framework of risk assessment for flash floods, vulnerability is a key concept to assess the susceptibility of elements at risk. Vulnerability is defined as expected degree of loss for an element at risk due to a hazard impact of a defined magnitude and frequency. Besides the increasing number of studies on flash floods available, in-depth information on vulnerability was missing so far. In order to close this gap, a vulnerability model was created for micro-sized enterprises exposed to flash floods in greece. This model was based on a nonlinear regression approach using data from four different events. By means of bootstrapping, different functions were fitted to the data, and a modified weibull distribution was found to represent the relationship between process magnitude and degree of loss best. Moreover, there is no need to distinguish between different business sectors when computing vulnerability for buildings exposed. The model can be applied on a local scale and may serve as a basis for flash flood risk management.",VULNERABILITY; FLASH FLOODS; LOSS ASSESSMENT; MICRO-SIZED ENTERPRISES; GREECE,SOCIAL VULNERABILITY;

We focus the analysis on people's behaviors observing how they use this period to organize themselves for facing the event. The analysis is made through the definition of three specific scales: the timeliness scale, an analytical scale of anticipatory actions and the scale of human response network. Using a cross-scale and cross level analysis enables to define different phases in the anticipation period where different kind of environmental precursors are mobilized by the actors in order to make sense of the situation and adapt. Three main points deserve attention at the end: firstly, the concepts of timeliness, anticipatory actions and crisis network scales enable to understand differently what happens both physically and socially during an extreme event, secondly, analyzing the precursors shows that each level of crisis network uses different kinds of signs for estimating the situation, organizing and reacting, thirdly, there is a potential for improvement in observation on both social and physical processes at different scales, for verifying the theory of the anticipatory phases.

However, there is scant literature assessing the validity of models pertaining to asd, particularly among asian adolescent samples. This study aims to address this gap by examining the latent structure of five proposed models of asd among adolescent survivors of a deadly flash flood. Two hundred twenty-five (225) respondents were assessed using the acute stress disorder interview within a month after a flash flood disaster. Series of confirmatory factor analyses indicated that a five-factor inter-correlated model (dissociation, intrusion, avoidance, dysphoric arousal and anxious arousal) yielded a more nuanced structure that portrays the subtleties in the data that are glossed over and missed by one-factor dsm-5 and even other multifactor models.",ACUTE STRESS DISORDER; FACTOR STRUCTURE; ADOLESCENT; DISASTER,CONFIRMATORY FACTOR-ANALYSIS; PTSD; HYPERAROUSAL; INTERVIEW; CHILDREN; SCALE; DISSOCIATION; EARTHQUAKE; ETIOLOGY; AROUSAL,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"ACHESON DT, 2012, NEUROPHARMACOLOGY, V62, P674, DOI 10.1016/J.NEUROPHARM.2011.04.029.;AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, 2013, DIAGN STAT MAN MENT.;AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, 1994, DIAGN STAT MAN MENT.;AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, 2000, DIAGN STAT MAN MENT.;ARMOUR C, 2011, J ANXIETY DISORD, V25, P80, DOI 10.1016/J.JANXDIS.2010.08.006.;ARRNOUR C, 2013, PSYCHOL TRAUMA-US, V5, P18, DOI 10.1037/A0024848.;BAELLO J., 2007, J MULTICULTURAL GEND, V1, P1.;BLUNCH N.J., 2008, INTRO STRUCTURAL EQU.;BROOKS R, 2008, J TRAUMA STRESS, V21, P352, DOI 10.1002/JTS.20333.;BRYANT RA, 1998, PSYCHOL ASSESSMENT, V10, P215, DOI 10.1037/1040-3590.10.3.215.;BRYANT RA, 2008, ARCH GEN PSYCHIAT, V65, P659, DOI 10.1001/ARCHPSYC.65.6.659.;BRYANT RA, 2011, DEPRESS ANXIETY, V28, P802, DOI 10.1002/DA.20737.;BRYANT RA, 2011, BEHAV RES THER, V49, P346, DOI 10.1016/J.BRAT.2011.03.003.;BRYANT RA, 2010, SLEEP, V33, P69, DOI 10.1093/SLEEP/33.1.69.;BYRNE B.

The assessment of the impacts of certain ece to human health has become essential to health managers and caregivers. The objective of this study was to identify the association between rates of hospitalization for leptospirosis and the occurrence of extreme hydrological events in the state santa catarina (brazil) between the years 2005 and 2014. The association between leptospirosis hospitalizations and the occurrence of floods, flash floods, and flooding events was measured through spearman's bivariate correlation coefficient. Flash floods corresponded to 92.6\% of the total hydrological events. Coastal regions presented higher admission rates than inland. The leptospirosis presented a seasonal pattern, with a peak in the summer months. Positive and significant correlations for monthly and annual analyzes were identified for some of the analyzed macro-regions, with higher values of correlation in the coastal region. The current results suggest the influence of the occurrence of extreme hydro-meteorological events on the variability of the hospitalization rate by leptospirosis in the state of santa catarina, with significant differences found for the coastal and inland regions.",HEALTH IMPACTS; FLOODS; HEALTH INDICATORS; LEPTOSPIROSIS,CLIMATE-CHANGE; HEALTH; IMPACTS; FLOODS; DISEASES; WATER,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,none,"PERES, WE, NUNES, B (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV NOVA LISBOA, CTR INVEST SAUDE PUBL, ESCOLA NACL SAUDE PUBL, P-1600560 LISBON, PORTUGAL.;PERES, WE (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV PERNAMBUCO, CAMPUS PETROLINA, BR-56328900 PETROLINA, PE, BRAZIL.;RUSSO, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV LISBON, FAC CIENCIAS, IDL, P-1749016 LISBON, PORTUGAL.;NUNES, B (REPRINT AUTHOR), INST NACL SAUDE DOUTOR RICARDO JORGE, AVE PADRE CRUZ, P-1649016 LISBON, PORTUGAL.;PERES, WOLMIR ERCIDES, NUNES, BALTAZAR, UNIV NOVA LISBOA, CTR INVEST SAUDE PUBL, ESCOLA NACL SAUDE PUBL, P-1600560 LISBON, PORTUGAL.;PERES, WOLMIR ERCIDES, UNIV PERNAMBUCO, CAMPUS PETROLINA, BR-56328900 PETROLINA, PE, BRAZIL.;RUSSO, ANA, UNIV LISBON, FAC CIENCIAS, IDL, P-1749016 LISBON, PORTUGAL.;NUNES, BALTAZAR, INST NACL SAUDE DOUTOR RICARDO JORGE, AVE PADRE CRUZ, P-1649016 LISBON, PORTUGAL.",10.3390/W11051052,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,FUNDACAO PARA A CIENCIA E TECNOLOGIAPORTUGUESE FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY [SFRH/BPD/99757/2014],,,5,,MDPI,11,2019,ISI000472680400182,41,WATER RESOURCES,0,WATER RESOURCES,WOLMIR.PERESUPE.BR ACRUSSOFC.UL.PT BNUNESENSP.UNL.PT,,IE9FN,,"PERES, WE, NUNES, B (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV NOVA LISBOA, CTR INVEST SAUDE PUBL, ESCOLA NACL SAUDE PUBL, P-1600560 LISBON, PORTUGAL",ISI,UNIV NOVA LISBOA;UNIV PERNAMBUCO;UNIV LISBON;INST NACL SAUDE DOUTOR RICARDO JORGE,UNIV NOVA LISBOA,,"PERES WE, 2019, WATER","PERES WE, 2019, WATER",FALSE,0,2,0,0,0,3,11,0,1

Using cross-sectional survey data collected in 2013 and 2014, we applied the integrated data envelopment analysis (dea)-based network model to estimate a composite resilience score, ranging from zero to one, and decomposed into coping and adaptive capacities. The overall resilience score of households is, on average, 0.75, while the average coping and adaptive capacity scores are 0.61 and 0.92, respectively. The correlation of the overall resilience with the adaptive capacity is significantly higher than that of the overall resilience and the coping capacity. This implies that adaptation measures of households mainly depend on external assistance that enables vulnerable households to recover from calamity, and thus effectively achieve post-event life stabilization. No significant difference in the overall resilience scores is found among villages in the surveyed area.",ASIA; PHILIPPINES; DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT; COMMUNITY-BASED ADAPTATION; RESILIENCE; COPING CAPACITY; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; NETWORK DATA ENVELOPMENT ANALYSIS (NDEA),FRONTIER MODELS; INFLUENTIAL OBSERVATIONS; MANAGERIAL EFFICIENCY; DETECTING OUTLIERS; DEA; LANDSLIDES; FLOODS; DAMAGE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"VILLANO, RA (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV NEW ENGLAND, UNE BUSINESS SCH, ARMIDALE, NSW 2351, AUSTRALIA.;VILLANO, RENATO A., TRAN, CAROLYN-DUNG THI THANH, UNIV NEW ENGLAND, UNE BUSINESS SCH, ARMIDALE, NSW 2351, AUSTRALIA.;MAGCALE-MACANDOG, DAMASA B., EUGENIO, ELENA A., MACANDOG, PAULA BEATRICE M., UNIV PHILIPPINES BANOS, INST BIOL SCI, LAGUNA, PHILIPPINES.;ACOSTA, LILIBETH A., UNIV PHILIPPINES BANOS, DEPT COMMUNITY \& ENVIRONM RESOURCE PLANNING, COLL HUMAN ECOL, LAGUNA, PHILIPPINES.;ACOSTA, LILIBETH A., GLOBAL GREEN GROWTH INST, THOUGHT LEADERSHIP DIV, SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA.;TRAN, CAROLYN-DUNG THI THANH, INT COLL MANAGEMENT, SYDNEY, NSW, AUSTRALIA.",10.1080/17565529.2019.1599317,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,"OSCAR M.

Most current large-scale assessments use an aggregated land-use category to represent the exposure, treating all exposed elements the same. For large areas where previously only coarse information existed such as in africa, more detailed exposure data are becoming available. For our approach, a direct relation between the construction type and building material of the exposed elements is used to develop vulnerability curves. We further present a method to differentiate flood risk in urban and rural areas based on characteristics of the built environment. We applied the model to ethiopia and found that rural flood risk accounts for about 22\% of simulated damage, rural damage is generally neglected in the typical land-use-based damage models, particularly at this scale. Our approach is particularly interesting for studies in areas where there is a large variation in construction types in the building stock, such as developing countries.",,PHYSICAL VULNERABILITY; DISASTER RISK; FLASH FLOODS; FRAMEWORK; DAMAGE; RIVER; DATABASE; HAZARDS; PROTECTION; LAYERS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,none,"ENGLHARDT, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), VRIJE UNIV AMSTERDAM, INST ENVIRONM STUDIES IVM, DE BOELELAAN 1087, NL-1081 HV AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS.;ENGLHARDT, JOHANNA, DE MOEL, HANS, DE RUITER, MARLEEN C., AERTS, JEROEN C.

A sample of 895 survivor-respondents answered the posttraumatic growth inventory (ptgi) within a month after a deadly flash flood. Based on the best-fitted model, a multi-group comparison between male and female was conducted to determine gender generalizability. Results showed that the 3-factor model comprising of changes in self/positive life attitudes, philosophy of life, and relating to others fitted best in contrast to the other two models. The data also demonstrated the generalizability of the 3-factor model across gender, with invariance in factor loadings, item intercepts, factor variance and covariance, and factor means.",POSTTRAUMATIC GROWTH; LATENT STRUCTURE; CFA; FILIPINOS,ACUTE STRESS DISORDER; PSYCHOMETRIC PROPERTIES; INVENTORY; CHILDREN; VERSION; US; INDIVIDUALISM; COLLECTIVISM; INVARIANCE; DISTRESS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,5,"AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, 2013, DIAGN STAT MAN MENT.;BENTLER P.

Not all of these services may be equally valued by the public, however. This paper estimates households' willingness to pay (wtp) for improvements in water security, stream health, recreational and amenity values, as well as reduction in flood risk and urban heat island effect. We use data from nearly 1000 personal interviews with residential homeowners in melbourne and sydney, australia. Our results suggest that the wtp for the highest levels of all environmental services is a\$799 per household per year. Wtp is mainly driven by residents valuing improvements in local stream health, exemptions in water restrictions, the prevention of flash flooding, and decreased peak urban temperatures respectively at a\$297, a\$244, a\$104 and a\$65 per year. We further conduct a benefit transfer analysis and find that the wtp and compensating surplus are not significantly different between the study areas. Our findings provide additional support that stormwater management via green infrastructures have large nonmarket benefits and that, under certain conditions, benefit values can be transferred to different locations.",,WILLINGNESS-TO-PAY; MIXED LOGIT; MODEL; MELBOURNE; AUSTRALIA; SYDNEY; VALUES; JAPAN; TESTS; WATER,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,6,"ANDO AW, 2011, WATER RESOUR RES, V47, DOI 10.1029/2011WR011070.;AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS (ABS), 2016, REG POP GROWTH.;BALCOMBE K, 2011, J ENVIRON ECON MANAG, V62, P446, DOI 10.1016/J.JEEM.2011.04.004.;BIN O, 2004, LAND ECON, V80, P490, DOI 10.2307/3655805.;BRADEN J.

45,Bae H,Urban stream restoration in korea: design considerations and residents' willingness to pay,URBAN FORESTRY \& URBAN GREENING,"Urban streams in korea, which until recently were channeled and served only flood control functions, have increasingly attracted attention for their potential as urban parks or residential open spaces. Consequently, urban stream restoration has been booming and a number of restoration projects have been carried out since 1990s. However, increased flash flood risks created by climate change are reigniting controversies regarding the vulnerability of restored streams to flooding. Furthermore, implementation issues including landscape/greening and facility design considerations have been under-investigated. This study explores these ongoing issues associated with urban stream restoration in korea, as well as attempts to estimate consumers' willingness to pay for the restoration process. In particular, this study estimates the partial values of natural and recreational attributes of urban streams, which can be improved through various types of urban stream restoration measures, using conjoint analysis. The findings indicate that improving natural attributes by transforming existing concrete-encased streams into natural state streams increases the value of an urban stream by about 50 usd per household. Improving recreational attributes, either by creating a walkway where there is no bank or by expanding facilities to the existing walkway, increases the value of an urban stream by about 25 usd per household. These estimated partial values of urban stream attributes imply the relative importance of each attribute and suggest policy implications for priority setting and trade-offs in urban restoration projects.

34,Holub M;Fuchs S,Benefits of local structural protection to mitigate torrent-related hazards,RISK ANALYSIS VI: SIMULATION AND HAZARD MITIGATION,"The increasing land-use activities in european mountain regions have led to a considerable threat of natural hazards such as flash floods and debris flows in areas used for settlement purposes and economic activities. To mitigate associated losses, traditional protective measures, including check dams and retention basins, were commonly implemented by public authorities. However, due to the scarceness of public funds, efficient protection alternatives have to be developed to reduce future expenditures. Supplementing the concept of integral risk management, this efficiency can be obtained by local structural protection, reducing the vulnerability of buildings and infrastructure facilities considerably. However, data related to the effects of local structural protection measures to reduce losses has not been quantified satisfyingly so far, and the associated decrease in vulnerability has hardly been measured until now. In this paper, results of a comparative standardised cost benefit analysis are presented. Different mitigation strategies were assessed and the benefit of local structural measures was quantified. The results suggest that local structural measures reduce the vulnerability of buildings towards natural hazards considerably, and that they therefore should be considered as either additional or even alternative mitigation measures.",INTEGRAL RISK MANAGEMENT; VULNERABILITY; COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS; LOCAL STRUCTURAL MEASURES; NATURAL HAZARDS,RISK-ASSESSMENT; SWITZERLAND,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,31,"*BMLFUW, 2005, RICHTL WIRTSCH PRIOR.","HOLUB, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV NAT RESOURCES \& APPL LIFE SCI, INST MT RISK ENGN, VIENNA, AUSTRIA.;HOLUB, M., FUCHS, S., UNIV NAT RESOURCES \& APPL LIFE SCI, INST MT RISK ENGN, VIENNA, AUSTRIA.",10.2495/RISK080391,"ASHURST LODGE, ASHURST, SOUTHAMPTON SO40 7AA, ENGLAND","BREBBIA, CA",,978-1-84564-104-7,,,401-411,WIT PRESS/COMPUTATIONAL MECHANICS PUBLICATIONS,,2008,ISI000256668100039,18,GEOLOGY,17,"GEOLOGY, GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY",,,BHV30,RISK ANALYSIS VI: SIMULATION AND HAZARD MITIGATION,"HOLUB, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV NAT RESOURCES \& APPL LIFE SCI, INST MT RISK ENGN, VIENNA, AUSTRIA",ISI,UNIV NAT RESOURCES AND APPL LIFE SCI,UNIV NAT RESOURCES AND APPL LIFE SCI,,"HOLUB M, 2008, RISK ANALYSIS VI: SIMULATION AND HAZARD MITIGATION","HOLUB M, 2008, RISK ANALYSIS VI: SIMULATION AND HAZARD MITIGATION",FALSE,1,3_6,2,0,0,2_6,11,0,2
127,Gissing A;Haynes K;Coates L;Keys C,Motorist behaviour during the 2015 shoalhaven floods,AUSTRALIAN JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT,"People entering floodwaters by vehicle constitutes a major cause of flood fatalities in australia and globally. Over the 20 years to 2014, 81 people have died attempting to drive through floodwaters. These comprise 43 per cent of all flood fatalities for this period. Despite australian emergency services agencies mounting behavioural change campaigns and urging people not to enter floodwater, the behaviour persists. This paper draws on fieldwork carried out during flooding in the shoalhaven region of nsw, australia, in august 2015 to examine the effectiveness of the current combination of warnings, education and road signage to stop motorists entering floodwater. The fieldwork identified that 84 per cent of drivers at a monitored site, notably males and four-wheel-drive (4wd) vehicles, dismissed road closure signs and drove into floodwater. It is plain that further work is needed to reduce the frequency of motorists entering floodwater.

201,Milanesi L;Pilotti M;Belleri A;Marini A;Fuchs S,Vulnerability to flash floods: a simplified structural model for masonry buildings,WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH,"Urban and land use planning is conditioned by flood risk analyses and is a great research challenge. While methods are available for quantitative hazard and risk modeling, there is still a major gap related to reliable rational approaches for vulnerability assessment. This is particularly true for assessing vulnerability of buildings to floods. This vulnerability, which is important for economic reasons as well as for the safety of individuals and communities, is usually conceptualized on an empirical basis. Such empirical approaches, however, are plagued by considerable uncertainties, mostly because the damage-causing mechanisms on the building envelope are poorly represented. In order to advance this area, this paper focuses on the structural vulnerability of traditional masonry buildings in alpine areas exposed to flash floods. A simplified physically based conceptual model which requires a limited amount of input data is proposed. The resistance of a wall impacted by a flash flood is studied in a limit analysis framework, considering different geometric ratios and building configurations. The resulting stability thresholds, expressed in dimensionless form as a function of the water depth, were positively compared with the results provided by numerical finite element models of the investigated geometries. The application of the proposed vulnerability model in risk mitigation strategies provides reliable information, suitable for a first-level risk assessment on large building stocks.",,DAM-BREAK FLOW; DEBRIS FLOWS; PHYSICAL VULNERABILITY; LIMIT ANALYSIS; RISK; HAZARDS; EXPOSURE; IMPACT; STABILITY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"AKBAS S., 2009, P LANDSL PROC GEOM M, P229.;ALCRUDO F, 2007, J HYDRAUL RES, V45, P45, DOI 10.1080/00221686.2007.9521832.;ALEXANDER J, 2016, SEDIMENTOLOGY, V63, P1582, DOI 10.1111/SED.12274.;ANCEY C, 2008, WATER RESOUR RES, V44, DOI 10.1029/2007WR006353.;ARMANINI A, 2011, P 5 INT C DEBR FLOW, P1041, DOI DOI 10.4408/IJEGE.2011-03.B-113.;ARRIGHI C, 2015, J FLUID STRUCT, V57, P170, DOI 10.1016/J.JFLUIDSTRUCTS.2015.06.010.;AURELI F, 2015, ADV WATER RESOUR, V76, P29, DOI 10.1016/J.ADVWATRES.2014.11.009.;BLACK R., 1975, FLOOD PROOFING RURAL.;BRASCHI G., 1992, P HYDROSOFT 92, P381.;CLAUSEN L, 1990, INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RIVER FLOOD HYDRAULICS, P369.;COMINELLI S, 2017, MATER STRUCT, V50, DOI 10.1617/S11527-016-0905-6.;COMO M., 2016, STATICS HIST MASONRY.;COSTABILE P, 2012, J HYDROINFORM, V14, P122, DOI 10.2166/HYDRO.2011.077.;CROSS R.

329,Mohammadinia A;Disfani Mm;Narsilio Ga;Aye L,Mechanical behaviour and load bearing mechanism of high porosity permeable pavements utilizing recycled tire aggregates,CONSTRUCTION AND BUILDING MATERIALS,"The benefits of permeable paving systems (pps) in minimizing surface water run-off which in turn reduces the imposed pressure on stormwater collection systems at the time of flash flooding have been recently remarked profoundly. In addition, the pps have additional advantages such as filtering the pollutants for downstream water collection systems and accommodating transformation of nutrients and water to the surrounding vegetation. Inclusion of end-of-life tire products in the mixture of pps can adjust the flexibility of the final product. Tire aggregates will potentially enhance the final product performance in areas where the ground movement or intrusion of roots can cause damage to conventional rigid pavement systems. The effect of addition of waste tire and rubber aggregates to solid granular material have been investigated in the past, however, their focus have been mainly on creating highly compacted mixtures. In contrast, in this study, mixtures of soft (end-of-life tire aggregates) and rigid aggregates (crushed rock) with a relatively high porosity was tested to evaluate their suitability for construction of permeable pavements which require high porosity. The flexibility of mixtures and their stress dependant behaviour was investigated based on the volumetric fraction of soft aggregates in the blend. The transitional soft-rigid behaviour of the mixture can be utilized to mitigate the unexpected deformation induced on the pavement. The compressive behaviour of highly permeable mixtures under k(o) loading and deviatoric shear provides an insight on the formation of force chains in the mixtures between the rigid particles. In addition, monitoring the compressive behaviour of rigid-soft aggregates under k(o) loading explains soft aggregates cushioning impact on improving the compressibility and shear behaviour of the mixture.

The flexural response of the lwf/rc beams is investigated in terms of crack load, load-deflection curves, stiffness, energy absorption capacity, ductility index, ultimate flexural load-to-weight ratio, load-strain curves, crack patterns, number of cracks, average crack width, crack spacing, and the failure mode. The test results reveal the remarkable enhancement in the flexural behavior and potential application for reconstruction of flash flood victims lost residence utilizing lightweight sandwich composite technology. The method outlined by aci building code is used to compute ultimate moment capacities. The results obtained using this method are compared with the experimental results.",FLASH FLOOD VICTIMS; FLEXURAL RESPONSE; LIGHTWEIGHT SANDWICH COMPOSITE; POLYSTYRENE FOAM BLOCK; STAINLESS STEEL MESHES; ULTIMATE MOMENT CAPACITIES,FERROCEMENT; PANELS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,4,"AL-QUDAH KA, 2011, JORDAN J CIV ENG, V5, P148.;[ANONYMOUS], 1988, ACI STRUCT J, V85, P325.;EL-WAFA M.

121,Hu P;Zhang Q;Shi P;Chen B;Fang J,Flood-induced mortality across the globe: spatiotemporal pattern and influencing factors,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Impacts of floods on human society have been drawing increasing human concerns in recent years. In this study, flood observations from em-dat (emergency events database) and dfo (dartmouth flood observatory) datasets were analyzed to investigate frequency and intensity of floods, and flood-induced mortality, flood-affected population as well during 1975-2016 across the globe. Results indicated that: (1) occurrence rate of floods, flood-induced mortality and flood-affected population were generally increasing globally. However, flood-induced mortality and flood-affected people per flood event were in slight decrease, indicating that flood-induced mortality and flood-affected people due to increased floods exceeded those by individual flood event, (2) annual variation of mortality per flood event is highly related to floods with higher intensity. Specifically, the flood frequency and flood-induced mortality are the largest in asia, specifically in china, india, indonesia and philippine, while significantly increased flood-affected population and mean annual mortality was detected in china, usa and australia, (3) tropical cyclones (tc) are closely related to flood-induced mortality in parts of the countries along the western coast of the oceans. The frequency of channel floods in these regions is the largest and large proportion of flood-induced deaths and the highest flood-induced mortality can be attributed to tc-induced flash floods, (4) population density and gdp per unit area are in significantly positive correlation with the number of flood-related victims per unit area, number of deaths and economic losses with exception of low-income countries. However, the flood-affected population and flood-induced mortality increase with decrease of per capita gdp, while the per capita economic loss increases with the increase of per capita gdp, indicating that the higher the population density and gdp per unit for a region, the higher sensitivity of this area to flood hazards.

Very large impacts including high numbers of fatalities occur due to single storm surge flood events. Here, we report on impacts of global coastal storm surge events since the year 1900, based on a compilation of events and data on loss of life. We find that over the past, more than eight thousand people are killed and 1.5 million people are affected annually by storm surges. The occurrence of very substantial loss of life (>10 000 persons) from single events has however decreased over time. Moreover, there is a consistent decrease in event mortality, measured by the fraction of exposed people that are killed, for all global regions, except south east asia. Average mortality for storm surges is slightly higher than for river floods, but lower than for flash floods. We also find that for the same coastal surge water level, mortality has decreased over time. This indicates that risk reduction efforts have been successful, but need to be continued with projected climate change, increased rates of sea-level rise and urbanisation in coastal zones.",LOSS OF LIFE; STORM SURGE; COAST; VULNERABILITY; MORTALITY; CLIMATE CHANGE,BANGLADESH CYCLONE; LIFE; CLIMATE; LOSSES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,8,"ALAM E, 2015, INT J CLIMATOL, V35, P801, DOI 10.1002/JOC.4035.;ANTTILA-HUGHES J., 2013, DESTRUCTION DISINVES.;BOUWER LM, 2013, RISK ANAL, V33, P915, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.2012.01880.X.;CHOWDHURY AMR, 1993, DISASTERS, V17, P291, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-7717.1993.TB00503.X.;FRITZ HM, 2009, NAT GEOSCI, V2, P448, DOI 10.1038/NGEO558.;HALLEGATTE S, 2013, NAT CLIM CHANGE, V3, P802, DOI [10.1038/NCLIMATE1979, 10.1038/NCLIMATE1979].;HANDMER J, 2012, MANAGING RISKS EXTRE, P231, DOI DOI 10.1017/CBO9781139177245.;HOFFMAN RN, 2010, WEATHER CLIM SOC, V2, P271, DOI 10.1175/2010WCAS1050.1.;JONGMAN B, 2015, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V112, PE2271, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.1414439112.;JONKMAN SN, 2008, J FLOOD RISK MANAG, V1, P43, DOI 10.1111/J.1753-318X.2008.00006.X.;JONKMAN SN, 2011, RISK ANAL, V31, P282, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.2010.01502.X.;JONKMAN SN, 2009, RISK ANAL, V29, P676, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.2008.01190.X.;JONKMAN SN, 2005, NAT HAZARDS, V34, P151, DOI 10.1007/S11069-004-8891-3.;LIN N, 2012, NAT CLIM CHANGE, V2, P462, DOI 10.1038/NCLIMATE1389.;LUMBROSO DM, 2017, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V17, P1357, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-17-1357-2017.;MAASKANT B, 2009, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V12, P157, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2008.11.004.;MECHOULAM R, 2014, CANNABINOIDS, P1, DOI 10.1007/S10584-014-1141-0.;NATEGHI R, 2016, PLOS ONE, V11, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0158375.;NEEDHAM HF, 2015, REV GEOPHYS, V53, P545, DOI 10.1002/2014RG000477.;PAUL BK, 2009, NAT HAZARDS, V50, P289, DOI 10.1007/S11069-008-9340-5.;PEARS-PIGGOTT MIB, 2016, INT J DISAST RISK RE, V17, P123, DOI 10.1016/J.IJDRR.2016.04.002.;PEDUZZI P, 2012, NAT CLIM CHANGE, V2, P289, DOI 10.1038/NCLIMATE1410.;RAPPAPORT EN, 2014, B AM METEOROL SOC, V95, P341, DOI 10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00074.1.;SHULTZ JM, 2005, EPIDEMIOL REV, V27, P21, DOI 10.1093/EPIREV/MXI011.;UNITED NATIONS INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY FOR DISASTER REDUCTION ( UNISDR), 2015, SEND FRAM DIS RISK R.;VOUSDOUKAS MI, 2016, CLIM DYNAM, V47, P3171, DOI 10.1007/S00382-016-3019-5.","BOUWER, LM (REPRINT AUTHOR), DELTARES, DELFT, NETHERLANDS.;BOUWER, LAURENS M., DELTARES, DELFT, NETHERLANDS.;JONKMAN, SEBASTIAAN N., DELFT UNIV TECHNOL, FAC CIVIL ENGN \& GEOSCI, DEPT HYDRAUL ENGN, DELFT, NETHERLANDS.",10.1088/1748-9326/AA98A3,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",,CLIMATE CHANGE AND ADAPTIVE PLANNING PROGRAMME OF DELTARES; EUROPEAN UNION'SHORIZON BRIGAID PROJECT [700699]; DUTCH NWO TTW PROJECT SAFELEVEE [13861],,1748-9326,1,,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,13,2018,ISI000419385900001,26,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES",10,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES",LAURENS.BOUWERDELTARES.NL,,FR9HZ,,"BOUWER, LM (REPRINT AUTHOR), DELTARES, DELFT, NETHERLANDS",ISI,DELTARES;DELFT UNIV TECHNOL,DELTARES,,"BOUWER LM, 2018, ENVIRON RES LETT","BOUWER LM, 2018, ENVIRON RES LETT",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,1,13,1,7

Influences of typhoon activities on droughts and floods are also analysed. Results based on extensive and thorough investigations indicate that (1) generally, guangdong province is both humid and warm, however, in recent decades, the negative impacts of droughts seem to be enhancing, which is proved by increasing drought-induced economic loss. In this sense, considerable importance should be attached to droughts, but not solely to floods, in the guangdong province, (2) low-lying terrain of the guangdong province makes this region easy to be influenced by flood inundation. Moreover, highly urbanized areas are mostly located in the low-lying areas. Flood-induced loss was increasing before 1990s and is decreasing after 1990s, and this should be attributed mainly to seasonal shifts of precipitation changes and enhancing human mitigation to flood disasters, (3) typhoon activities often inflict considerable loss on the economy of the guangdong province. Moreover, flood events in the study region are mostly the results of typhoon activities.

319,Aceto L;Caloiero T;Pasqua Aa;Petrucci O,Analysis of damaging hydrogeological events in a mediterranean region (calabria),JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Damaging hydrogeological events (dhes) are periods of severe weather conditions affecting wide areas for several days, and causing mainly damaging landslides and floods. In order to characterise the dhes, we analysed the historical series of the events that affected a mediterranean region (calabria, southern italy) throughout 92 years of observation. Depending on their magnitude, we classified the events as: major catastrophic, catastrophic, extraordinary and ordinary. In winter events, damaged areas and damage were greater than those resulting from the other seasons. Nevertheless, the majority of the events took place in autumn, when, in addition to landslides, a relevant percentage of flash floods and floods also occurred. Results also show that the frequency of major catastrophic and catastrophic events has decreased since 1971, and that, in recent decades, calabria has suffered from damaging effects even though rain did not reached extreme characteristics. In fact, the duration of triggering rain, the maximum daily rain of the events and the out coming frequency of the high return period of rain show a decreasing pattern throughout the study period. As to what concerns the damaging phenomena, landslides were identified as the most frequent in every season and in every type of events, the eastern side of the region was the most frequently and heavily damaged. According to literature, the trend of number of victims per event is also decreasing. The proposed analysis can be applied to different study areas in order to assess the relative magnitude of dhes and their evolution throughout the years. The classification criterion can be useful to compare different events for either scientific or insurance purposes, and to identify the typical rainfall-damage scenario of a study area.

To complete this study, we analysed pressgama and inungama databases to look for all the information related to the floods and flash floods that have affected the chosen region. The consorcio de compensacion de seguros, a state insurance company for extraordinary risks, provided data on economic damage. The extreme precipitation trend was analysed by the fabra observatory and el prat-airport observatory, and daily precipitation data were provided by the state meteorological agency of spain (aemet) and the meteorological service of catalonia (smc). Population data were obtained from the statistical institute of catalonia (idescat). Changes in land use were estimated from the land use maps for catalonia corresponding to 1956, 1993, 2000, 2005 and 2009. Prevention measures like rainwater tanks and improvements to the drainage system were also been considered. The specific case of barcelona is presented, a city recognised by united nations international strategy for disaster reduction as a model city for urban resilience to floods. The evolution of flood events in the mab does not show any significant trend for this period. We argue that the evolution in floods can be explained, at least in part, by the lack of trend in extreme precipitation indices, and also by the improvements in flood prevention measures.",FLOODS; FLASHFLOODS; CHANGES IN LAND USE; VULNERABILITY; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; BARCELONA,CATALONIA NE SPAIN; CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOCIAL IMPACT; MANAGEMENT; TRENDS; EVENT; PRECIPITATION; DATABASE; REGION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,"ALFIERI L, 2016, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V136, P507, DOI 10.1007/S10584-016-1641-1.;AMARO J, 2010, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V10, P2643, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-10-2643-2010.;[ANONYMOUS], 2012, INTERGOVERNMENTAL PA.;BARBERIA L, 2014, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V14, P1843, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-14-1843-2014.;BARNOLAS M, 2007, METODOLOGIA ESTUDIO.;BARREDO JI, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P1723, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-1723-2012.;BARRERA A, 2006, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V6, P505, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-6-505-2006.;BARRERA-ESCODA A, 2015, HYDROL EARTH SYST SC, V19, P465, DOI 10.5194/HESS-19-465-2015.;BARRIENDOS M, 2003, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V3, P583, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-3-583-2003.;BENOIT G, 2005, SUSTAINABLE FUTURE M.;BLOSCHL G, 2013, EMERGING APPROACHES, P3.;BODOQUE JM, 2016, J HYDROL, V541, P665, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2016.02.005.;LLASAT MC, 2016, J HYDROL, V541, P24, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2016.05.040.;LLASAT MC, 2014, ATMOS RES, V149, P230, DOI 10.1016/J.ATMOSRES.2014.05.024.;CASAS-CASTILLO C, 2005, MAPES PRECIPITACIO M.;CEOLA S, 2014, GEOPHYS RES LETT, V41, P7184, DOI 10.1002/2014GL061859.;CHOW V.

56,Sharif Ho;Jackson Tl;Hossain Mm;Zane D,Analysis of flood fatalities in texas,NATURAL HAZARDS REVIEW,"Floods are the leading cause of fatalities connected with natural disasters in texas. A combination of physiography and precipitation often result in extreme hydrologic conditions that cause floods in the state. This paper reviews flood-related fatalities in texas between 1959 and 2008. Information on flood-fatality victims and the flood-causing events was obtained from the national climatic data center. The data collected included the date, time, location, and weather conditions and the gender and age of the flood victims. Comparison with other states reveals that the size of the population of texas is a major factor in the increased number of fatalities. The data also suggest that driving or walking into floodwaters may be responsible for more than 93\% of flood fatalities in texas. Although most high-fatality counties are located in the texas ``flash flood alley that includes major urban centers, normalization of fatality data shows that the flood-fatality risk is actually higher in other areas of the state. The analysis also indicates that the annual flood-fatality rates are decreasing significantly. A combination of improved hydrometeorological forecasting, educational programs aimed at enhancing public awareness of flood risk and the seriousness of flood warnings, and timely and appropriate action by local emergency and safety authorities will help further reduce flood fatalities in texas.

133,Paul Sh;Sharif Ho;Crawford Am,Fatalities caused by hydrometeorological disasters in texas,GEOSCIENCES,"Texas ranks first in the u.s in number of fatalities due to natural disasters. Based on data culled from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) from 1959 to 2016, the number of hydrometeorological fatalities in texas have increased over the 58-year study period, but the per capita fatalities have significantly decreased. Spatial review found that non-coastal flooding is the predominant hydrometeorological disaster in a majority of the texas counties located in flash flood alley and accounts for 43\% of all hydrometeorological fatalities in the state. Flooding fatalities occur most frequently on transportation routes followed by heat fatalities in permanent residences. Seasonal and monthly stratification identifies spring and summer as the deadliest seasons, with the month of may registering the highest number of total fatalities dominated by flooding and tornado fatalities. Demographic trends of hydrometeorological disaster fatalities indicated that approximately twice as many male fatalities occurred from 1959-2016 than female fatalities, but with decreasing gender disparity over time. Adults are the highest fatality risk group overall, children are most at risk to die in flooding, and the elderly at greatest risk of heat-related death.",NATURAL HAZARDS; WEATHER DISASTERS; HYDROMETEOROLOGICAL FATALITIES; FLOODING; TORNADOES; EXTREME TEMPERATURES,FLOOD FATALITIES; UNITED-STATES; LIGHTNING FATALITIES; VULNERABILITY; AUSTRALIA; DAMAGES; KATRINA; INDIA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,5,"[ANONYMOUS], 2006, FOX NEWS.;ASHLEY ST, 2008, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V47, P805, DOI 10.1175/2007JAMC1611.1.;ASHLEY WS, 2007, WEATHER FORECAST, V22, P1214, DOI 10.1175/2007WAF2007004.1.;BADOUX A, 2016, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V16, P2747, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-16-2747-2016.;BORDEN KA, 2008, INT J HEALTH GEOGR, V7, DOI 10.1186/1476-072X-7-64.;BORDER PATROL, 2018, SW BORD SECT.;CHANGNON SA, 2000, B AM METEOROL SOC, V81, P437, DOI 10.1175/1520-0477(2000)081<0437:HFETIL>2.3.CO,2.;CHOWDHURY AMR, 1993, DISASTERS, V17, P291, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-7717.1993.TB00503.X.;COATES L, 1999, AUST GEOGR, V30, P391, DOI 10.1080/00049189993657.;CURRAN EB, 2000, J CLIMATE, V13, P3448, DOI 10.1175/1520-0442(2000)013<3448:LCADIT>2.0.CO,2.;CUTTER SL, 2008, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V105, P2301, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.0710375105.;CUTTER SL, 2018, NAT HAZARDS REV, V19, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)NH.1527-6996.0000268.;DOSA DM, 2008, J AM MED DIR ASSOC, V9, P599, DOI 10.1016/J.JAMDA.2008.05.007.;DOSA DM, 2007, J AM MED DIR ASSOC, V8, P142, DOI 10.1016/J.JAMDA.2006.11.004.;ELSOM DM, 2001, ATMOS RES, V56, P325, DOI 10.1016/S0169-8095(00)00083-1.;FITZGERALD G, 2010, EMERG MED AUSTRALAS, V22, P180, DOI 10.1111/J.1742-6723.2010.01284.X.;GERRITSEN H, 2005, PHILOS T R SOC A, V363, P1271, DOI 10.1098/RSTA.2005.1568.;HAHN DJ, 2017, ASCE-ASME J RIS UNCE, V3, DOI 10.1061/AJRUA6.0000897.;JONKMAN SN, 2009, RISK ANAL, V29, P676, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.2008.01190.X.;KURE S., 2016, ENG J, V58, DOI 10.1142/S0578563416400088.;LOMONACO C., 2006, PBS FRONTLINE WORLD.;MILCH K, 2018, ATMOSPHERE-BASEL, V9, DOI 10.3390/ATMOS9010032.;MUNICH RE NATCATSERVICE NATURAL CATASTROPHE KNOW HOW FOR RISK MANAGEMENT AND RESEARCH, NAT CAT KNOW HOW RIS.;NATIONAL OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC ADMINISTRATION.

When these systems occur close to land they can cause major damage to infrastructure and communities due to gale force winds, intense rainfall, storm surge and coastal erosion. In june 2007, newcastle and central coast regions of new south wales (nsw) experienced severe weather and subsequent flash flooding. The `pasha bulker' storm, as it has become known, was one of the most significant meteorological events in australia's history, with large economic losses and social disruption due to the loss of critical infrastructure. This paper provides background information on the meteorology of the event, the impact of the pasha bulker storm and a discussion of the lessons learned from the event and subsequent adaptation strategies employed. The paper also provides important reflections, at both regional and national level, on the pasha bulker storm and other similar storm events. Lessons for all levels of government and community groups are discussed, including preparedness before the event, actions during the event, and recovery processes post-event.

520,Li W;Hu K;Hu X;He B;Tu Y,Investments against flash floods and their effectiveness in china in 2000-2015,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,"Extreme hydrological events such as flash floods are likely to become more frequent and extreme because of increasingly extreme weather and climate events. Flash floods occur particularly frequently in china and cause huge losses to society annually. Consequently, the chinese government significantly increased the investments in comprehensive flash flood disaster prevention and mitigation systems. These measures (implemented in 2000-2015) played a pivotal role in reducing flash flood fatalities. The absolute annual death toll and average fatality rate in single torrential rainstorms in 2008-2015 decreased by 40\% and 42\% with the massively increased investments compared with those of previous years, respectively. However, the efficiency of fiscal investment in reducing flash flood fatalities has not been optimal at the national and provincial scales in most years. The technical inefficiency of the recent eight years was mainly influenced by the scale inefficiency at the national scale, by contrast, the technical inefficiency of the most recent years depended largely on pure technical efficiency (pte) on a provincial scale. This implies that fiscal investment should be allocated more reasonably through dynamic risk assessment at the national level, and the selection of prevention measures must place more emphasis on rationality and effectiveness in different areas. Pte at a regional scale should be increased by solving the limitations of existing measures. Hence, rigorous analyses are necessary. The results of this study offer a different perspective on flash flood disaster prevention systems and can be used to compare flood risk management method to those of other countries.",FLASH FLOOD FATALITIES; COUNTERMEASURES; RAINFALL-RELATED DEATHS; INVESTMENT EFFICIENCY,RISK-MANAGEMENT; UNITED-STATES; RAINFALL; POLICY; PRECIPITATION; DISTRIBUTE; EFFICIENCY; DAMAGES; JUSTICE; SYSTEM,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"HU, KH (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHINESE ACAD SCI, KEY LAB MT HAZARDS \& EARTH SURFACE PROC, 9,SECT 4,SOUTH RENMIN RD, CHENGDU 610041, SICHUAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.;LI, WEI, HU, KAIHENG, HU, XUDONG, CHINESE ACAD SCI, KEY LAB MT HAZARDS \& EARTH SURFACE PROC, 9,SECT 4,SOUTH RENMIN RD, CHENGDU 610041, SICHUAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.;LI, WEI, HU, KAIHENG, HU, XUDONG, CHINESE ACAD SCI, INST MT HAZARDS \& ENVIRONM, 9,SECT 4,SOUTH RENMIN RD, CHENGDU 610041, SICHUAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.;LI, WEI, HU, XUDONG, UNIV CHINESE ACAD SCI, 9,SECT 4,SOUTH RENMIN RD, BEIJING 100049, PEOPLES R CHINA.;HE, BINGSHUN, TU, YONG, RES CTR FLOOD \& DROUGHT DISASTER REDUCT MWR, BEIJING 100038, PEOPLES R CHINA.;HE, BINGSHUN, TU, YONG, CHINA INST WATER RESOURCES \& HYDROPOWER RES, STATE KEY LAB SIMULAT \& REGULAT WATER CYCLE RIVER, BEIJING 100038, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.1016/J.IJDRR.2019.101193,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [41790434]; NATIONAL KEY R\&D PROGRAM OF CHINA [2018YFC1505205]; PROJECT OF PERFORMANCE EVALUATION AND ANALYSIS OF FLASH FLOOD PREVENTION COUNTERMEASURES IN CHINA,,2212-4209,,,ELSEVIER,38,2019,ISI000477698300010,46,"GEOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",5,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",WEILIIMDE.AC.CN KHHUIMDE.AC.CN 83514768QQ.COM.CN,,IM0SA,,"HU, KH (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHINESE ACAD SCI, KEY LAB MT HAZARDS \& EARTH SURFACE PROC, 9,SECT 4,SOUTH RENMIN RD, CHENGDU 610041, SICHUAN, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,CHINESE ACAD SCI;INST MT HAZARDS AND ENVIRONM;UNIV CHINESE ACAD SCI;RES CTR FLOOD AND DROUGHT DISASTER REDUCT MWR;CHINA INST WATER RESOURCES AND HYDROPOWER RES,CHINESE ACAD SCI,,"LI W, 2019, INT J DISASTER RISK REDUCT","LI W, 2019, INT J DISASTER RISK REDUCT",FALSE,0,4_6,0,0,0,1_2,13,1,2
65,Salvati P;Petrucci O;Rossi M;Bianchi C;Pasqua Aa;Guzzetti F,"Gender, age and circumstances analysis of flood and landslide fatalities in italy",SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Floods and landslides are frequent and destructive geo-hydrological hazards that cause harm to people every year. We analysed data on 1292 landslide and 771 flood fatalities that occurred in italy in the 50-year period 1965-2014, to determine the dependence of the fatalities on gender and age and the circumstances of death by type of hazard. The multinomial probability mass function of the expected fatalities by gender and age, as reported by national census data, were estimated and compared with the observed landslide and flood fatalities. We identified the age categories over or under represented when the observed fatalities were respectively higher or lower than the modelled expected deaths. We found that in italy males are more vulnerable to floods and landslides for most of the age categories. Apart from children, males are over-represented up to the age of 89 for floods and up to 79 for landslides, whereas females are under-represented up to the age of 59 for floods and landslides, and over-represented above 70 for floods and between 60 and 79 for landslides. To consider the demographic and socio-cultural changes over time, we performed a temporal analysis splitting the record into two non-overlapping subsets of 25 year each. The analysis demonstrated that the over-representation of males compared to the females, both for landslide and flood is statistically significant and does not vary in time, indicating a different propensity towards the risk taking and a different degree of exposure between males and females. Analysis of the data allowed to identify the common circumstances of death. Landslides fatalities occurred frequently indoor, whereas the majority of the flood fatalities occurred outdoor, outlining the different dynamics of the hazards. Floods killed numerous people along roads and drivers or passengers travelling in vehicles. We expect that the results of this work will be helpful to design recommendations for self-protecting actions, and proactive policies that can contribute to reduce the human toll of floods and landslides in italy, and elsewhere.

71,Sharif Ho;Hossain Mm;Jackson T;Bin-Shafique S,Person-place-time analysis of vehicle fatalities caused by flash floods in texas,GEOMATICS NATURAL HAZARDS \& RISK,"A significant number of crashes on roads are caused by adverse weather conditions. Among the most serious consequences of rainfall and flooding in regard to road safety are the motor vehicle-related flash flood fatalities. These fatalities are of particular concern in texas. Information on motor vehicle fatalities caused by flash floods was extracted from the national climatic data center storm data reports. Review of reports on flash flood fatalities in general, where the death circumstances are provided, reveals that most fatalities are motor vehicle-related (80\%). Moreover, data from the reports indicate that from 1959 to 2009 the number of motor vehicle-related flash flood fatalities in texas exceeds by far the total number of flood fatalities in any other state. Demographic analysis of the flash flood fatalities indicates that, in texas, all ages are at risk and that males are much more affected than females. Spatial analysis indicates that the highest numbers of fatalities occur in counties having major urban areas. The increase in the frequency and intensity of storms and floods that is projected to result from climate changes and variability, and the rapid urbanization in the region may considerably increase the impacts of weather on road safety in texas.",,UNITED-STATES; WEATHER; TRANSPORTATION; PRECIPITATION; HAZARD; TRENDS; RISK,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,16,"ANDREY J, 2003, NAT HAZARDS, V28, P319, DOI 10.1023/A:1022934225431.;ASHLEY ST, 2008, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V47, P805, DOI 10.1175/2007JAMC1611.1.;BERTNESS J, 1980, J APPL METEOROL, V19, P545, DOI 10.1175/1520-0450(1980)019<0545:RRIOST>2.0.CO,2.;BRODSKY H, 1988, ACCIDENT ANAL PREV, V20, P161, DOI 10.1016/0001-4575(88)90001-2.;BROWN M, 2005, BEING FLOOD SMART ME.;BURBY R.

297,Terti G;Ruin I;Anquetin S;Gourley Jj,A situation-based analysis of flash flood fatalities in the united states,BULLETIN OF THE AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY,"This paper investigates the circumstances of 1,075 fatalities from flash flooding recorded from 1996 to 2014 across the United States. This study provides insights into the situations of the fatality events as determined by the victims’ profile and activity and the spatiotemporal context of the flooding. A reclassification of the individual fatality circumstance (i.e., location and/or activity) is performed to explore statistically the timing, the duration, and location of the flash flood event and the age and gender of the victims. In agreement with other studies, more than 60% of the reported fatalities were related to vehicles involving mainly males. A geospatial analysis indicated these were most common in southern states. Further, 21% of fatalities occurred outdoors, typically in neighborhoods near streams, where the victims were exhibiting high-risk-taking behavior, such as cleaning out drains and even playing in the floodwaters. Human vulnerability varies dynamically on a subdaily basis and depends on social and natural factors of the flash flood. For example, most campsite-related fatalities were associated with very fast-responding flash flood events (less than 5-h duration), occurred more commonly after midnight, and impacted younger females and males alike. On the other hand, fatalities related to inundation of permanent buildings were most commonly associated with longer-duration events and impacted the elderly. Situational rather than generic examination of vulnerability is required to realistically capture risky cases during short-fuse flood events.

Less frequent are floods that affect large regions. Although a large number of databases devoted exclusively to floods or considering all kind of natural hazards do exist, usually they only record catastrophic flood events. This paper deals with the new flood database that is being developed within the framework of hymex project. Results are focused on four regions representative of the nw sector of mediterranean europe: catalonia, spain, the balearic islands, spain, calabria, italy, and languedoc-roussillon, midi-pyrenees and paca, france. The common available 30-yr period starts in 1981 and ends in 2010. The paper shows the database structure and criteria, the comparison with other flood databases, some statistics on spatial and temporal distribution, and an identification of the most important events. The paper also provides a table that includes the date and affected region of all the catastrophic events identified in the regions of study, in order to make this information available for all audiences.",,CATALONIA NE SPAIN; FLASH FLOODS; LOSSES; FRANCE; SERIES; TRENDS; LIFE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,53,"ALTAVA-ORTIZ V, 2011, INT J CLIMATOL, V31, P1943, DOI 10.1002/JOC.2204.;AMARO J., 2011, 5 HYMEX WORKSH 17 19.;BARBERIA L., 2011, PLIN C MED STORMS DI.;BARNOLAS M, 2007, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V7, P271, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-7-271-2007.;BARNOLAS M., 2007, MONOGRAFIA CEDEX.;BARREDO JI, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P1723, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-1723-2012.;BARREDO JI, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P97, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-97-2009.;BARRERA A, 2006, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V6, P505, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-6-505-2006.;BARRIENDOS M, 2003, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V3, P583, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-3-583-2003.;CAMUFFO D., 1996, CLIMATIC VARIATIONS, P433, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-61113-1\_20.;DI MAURO M, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V63, P1083, DOI 10.1007/S11069-012-0207-4.;GAUME E, 2009, J HYDROL, V367, P70, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2008.12.028.;GRIMALT M., 2010, 4 HYMEX WORKSH JUN 2.;GRIMALT M., 2011, 5 HYMEX WORKSH 17 19.;GRIMALT M., 1992, GEOGRAFIA RISE MALLO.;GUZZETTI F, 1994, ENVIRON MANAGE, V18, P623, DOI 10.1007/BF02400865.;JONKMAN SN, 2008, J FLOOD RISK MANAG, V1, P43, DOI 10.1111/J.1753-318X.2008.00006.X.;LLASAT MC, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P2049, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-2049-2009.;LLASAT M.C., 2010, ADV GEOSCI, V26, P105, DOI DOI 10.5194/ADGE0-26-105-2010.;LLASAT M.

The study is included in one of the objectives of the working group 5, which is a transversal group of the hymex project dealing with all the aspects related to societal and ecological impacts of hydrometeorological extremes, as well as their perception and communication processes. One of the main points of the wg5 is the creation of a common database on floods and their societal impact, for the mediterranean region, as well as its analysis. Although some databases already exist and are frequently consulted, they are mainly focused on ``major catastrophic events. But the mediterranean region experiences every year a high number of minor flash-floods that, considered in their totality, produce important losses and disruptions of the everyday life.

The extraordinary deployment of advanced instrumentation, including instrumented aircrafts, and the use of several different operational weather forecast models, including hydrological models and marine models, allowed an unprecedented monitoring and analysis of high-impact weather events around the italian hydro-meteorological sites. This activity has seen strong collaboration between the italian scientific and operational communities. In this paper an overview of the italian organization during sop1 is provided, and selected intensive observation periods (iops) are described. A significant event for each italian target area is chosen for this analysis: iop2 (12-13 september 2012) in northeastern italy, iop13 (15-16 october 2012) in central italy and iop19 (3-5 november 2012) in liguria and tuscany. For each iop the meteorological characteristics, together with special observations and weather forecasts, are analyzed with the aim of highlighting strengths and weaknesses of the forecast modeling systems, including the hydrological impacts. The usefulness of having different weather forecast operational chains characterized by different numerical weather prediction models and/or different model set up or initial conditions is finally shown for one of the events (iop19).",,FORECASTING SYSTEM; PRECIPITATION; RAINFALL; SIMULATIONS; EVENTS; RADAR; FLOOD; IMPLEMENTATION; LANDSLIDE; NETWORK,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,38,"[ANONYMOUS], 2013, ADRIARADNET REPORT A.;BARBI A, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P2463, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-2463-2012.;BENZI R., 1997, ANN GEOFIS, V40, P1579.;BETZ HD, 2009, ATMOS RES, V91, P564, DOI 10.1016/J.ATMOSRES.2008.06.012.;BRESSON E, 2012, Q J ROY METEOR SOC, V138, P1751, DOI 10.1002/QJ.1911.;BUZZI A, 1994, METEOROL ATMOS PHYS, V53, P137, DOI 10.1007/BF01029609.;BUZZI A., 2012, P 14 EGU PLIN C MED.;CALAS C., 2013, SOP DEBR WORKSH 15 1.;CASAIOLI M., 2013, 7 HYMEX WORKSH 7 10.;CASAIOLI M, 2013, METEOROL APPL, V20, P150, DOI 10.1002/MET.1401.;COPPOLA E, 2007, HYDROLOG SCI J, V52, P579, DOI 10.1623/HYSJ.52.3.579.;DAVOLIO S, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P1671, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-1671-2009.;DAVOLIO S., 2014, B AM METEOROL UNPUB.;DROBINSKI P, 2014, B AM METEOROL SOC, V95, P1063, DOI 10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00242.1.;DROFA O.V., 2004, P 14 INT C CLOUDS PR, P1297.;DUCROCQ, 2010, HYMEX SCI PLAN VERSI, V2.;DUCROCQ V, 2008, Q J ROY METEOR SOC, V134, P131, DOI 10.1002/QJ.199.;DUCROCQ V, 2014, B AM METEOROL SOC, V95, P1083, DOI 10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00244.1.;DUFFOURG F, 2013, ATMOS SCI LETT, V14, P133, DOI 10.1002/ASL2.429.;DUFFOURG F, 2011, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V11, P1163, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-11-1163-2011.;FERRARIN C, 2013, OCEAN MODEL, V61, P38, DOI 10.1016/J.OCEMOD.2012.10.003.;FERRETTI R., 2012, P 14 EGU PLIN C MALL.;GUZZETTI F, 2005, ENVIRON MANAGE, V36, P15, DOI 10.1007/S00267-003-0257-1.;INGHILESI R, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P485, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-485-2012.;KAIN JS, 2004, J APPL METEOROL, V43, P170, DOI 10.1175/1520-0450(2004)043<0170:TKCPAU>2.0.CO,2.;KERKMANN J., 2012, EXPT 2 5 MINUTE SUPE.;LASTORIA B., 2006, ADV GEOSCI, V7, P223.;MALGUZZI P, 2006, J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS, V111, DOI 10.1029/2006JD007111.;MALGUZZI P, 1999, Q J ROY METEOR SOC, V125, P2291, DOI 10.1256/SMSQJ.55815.;MARIANI S, 2009, METEOROL ATMOS PHYS, V103, P79, DOI 10.1007/S00703-008-0340-5.;MARIANI S., 2014, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V2, P649, DOI [10.5194/NHESSD-2-649-2014, DOI 10.5194/NHESSD-2-649-2014].;MARSIGLI C., 2013, COSMO NEWSLETTER.;MEISCHNER PF, 1991, MON WEATHER REV, V119, P678, DOI 10.1175/1520-0493(1991)119<0678:ASLISG>2.0.CO,2.;MELANI S, 2013, ATMOS RES, V123, P151, DOI 10.1016/J.ATMOSRES.2012.09.006.;MIGLIETTA MM, 2012, MON WEATHER REV, V140, P3039, DOI 10.1175/MWR-D-11-00253.1.;MONTANI A, 2011, TELLUS A, V63, P605, DOI 10.1111/J.1600-0870.2010.00499.X.;PARODI A., 2012, EOS T AGU, V93, P225, DOI DOI 10.1029/2012EO240001.;PROTAT A, 2009, J ATMOS OCEAN TECH, V26, P1717, DOI 10.1175/2009JTECHA1246.1.;REBORA N, 2013, J HYDROMETEOROL, V14, P906, DOI 10.1175/JHM-D-12-083.1.;ROTUNNO R, 2001, J ATMOS SCI, V58, P1732, DOI 10.1175/1520-0469(2001)058<1732:MOIAR>2.0.CO,2.;ROTUNNO R, 2007, Q J ROY METEOR SOC, V133, P811, DOI 10.1002/QJ.67.;SALVATI P, 2010, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V10, P465, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-10-465-2010.;SILVESTRO F, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P2743, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-2743-2012.;SKAMAROCK W.

This paper reviews the motivation and foundation of medex, the gestation, history and organisation of the project, as well as the main products and scientific achievements obtained from it. Medex obtained the approval of world meteorological organisation (wmo) and can be considered as framed within other wmo actions, such as the alpine experiment (alpex), the mediterranean cyclones study project (mcp) and, to a certain extent, the observing system research and predictability experiment (thorpex) and the hydrological cycle in mediterranean experiment (hymex). Through two phases (2000-2005 and 2006-2010), medex has produced a specific database, with information about cyclones and severe or high impact weather events, several main reports and a specific data targeting system field campaign (dts-medex-2009). The scientific achievements are significant in fields like climatology, dynamical understanding of the physical processes and social impact of cyclones, as well as in aspects related to the location of sensitive zones for individual cases, the climatology of sensitivity zones and the improvement of the forecasts through innovative methods like mesoscale ensemble prediction systems.",,WESTERN MEDITERRANEAN CYCLONES; HIGH-IMPACT WEATHER; INTENSE PRECIPITATION EVENTS; FLASH-FLOOD EVENT; POTENTIAL-VORTICITY; SURFACE CYCLONES; SENSITIVITY CLIMATOLOGIES; OBJECTIVE CLIMATOLOGY; NUMERICAL SIMULATIONS; CIRCULATION PATTERNS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,41,"ALPERT P, 1990, J CLIMATE, V3, P1474, DOI 10.1175/1520-0442(1990)003<1474:IVOCTI>2.0.CO,2.;ALPERT P., 1990, TELLUS, SERIES A (DYNAMIC METEOROLOGY AND OCEANOGRAPHY), V42A, P65, DOI 10.1034/J.1600-0870.1990.00007.X.;ALPERT P, 1996, TELLUS A, V48, P209, DOI 10.1034/J.1600-0870.1996.T01-1-00002.X.;AMARO J, 2010, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V10, P2643, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-10-2643-2010.;AMENGUAL A, 2008, Q J ROY METEOR SOC, V134, P1221, DOI 10.1002/QJ.291.;AMENGUAL A, 2007, J HYDROMETEOROL, V8, P282, DOI 10.1175/JHM577.1.;ARGENCE S., 2006, ADV GEOSCI, V7, P251, DOI DOI 10.5194/ADGEO-7-251-2006.;ARGENCE S, 2009, Q J ROY METEOR SOC, V135, P865, DOI 10.1002/QJ.422.;ARGENCE S, 2008, Q J ROY METEOR SOC, V134, P1775, DOI 10.1002/QJ.314.;AYRAULT F, 2000, CR ACAD SCI II A, V330, P173, DOI 10.1016/S1251-8050(00)00121-X.;BERENGER M., 1960, TYPES TEMPS MEDITERR.;BERENGER M., 1955, ESSAI ETUDES METEORO.;BERTO A, 2004, METEOROL Z, V13, P189, DOI 10.1127/0941-2948/2004/0013-0189.;BOUGEAULT P, 2001, B AM METEOROL SOC, V82, P433, DOI 10.1175/1520-0477(2001)082<0433:TMSOP>2.3.CO,2.;BOUGEAULT P., 1997, INM WMO INT S CYC HA.;BOUTTIER F, 2012, MON WEATHER REV, V140, P3706, DOI 10.1175/MWR-D-12-00031.1.;BUZZI A, 1998, MON WEATHER REV, V126, P2369, DOI 10.1175/1520-0493(1998)126<2369:NSOTPF>2.0.CO,2.;BUZZI A., 2005, SUMMARY REPORT MEDEX.;CALLADO A., 2011, ADV GEOSCI, V26, P133, DOI [10.5194/ ADGEO-26-133-2011, DOI 10.5194/ADGEO-26-133-2011].;CAMPINS J, 1995, METEOROL ATMOS PHYS, V56, P209, DOI 10.1007/BF01030138.;CAMPINS J, 2000, INT J CLIMATOL, V20, P969, DOI 10.1002/1097-0088(200007)20:9<969::AID-JOC519>3.0.CO,2-4.;CAMPINS J, 2006, INT J CLIMATOL, V26, P323, DOI 10.1002/JOC.1275.;CAMPINS J, 2013, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V13, P2891, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-13-2891-2013.;CAMPINS J., 2007, ADV GEOSCI, V12, P115, DOI [10.5194/ADGEO-12-115-2007, DOI 10.5194/ADGEO-12-115-2007].;CAMPINS J., 2006, ADV GEOSCI, V7, P73, DOI [10.5194/ADGEO-7-73-2006, DOI 10.5194/ADGEO-7-73-2006].;CAMPINS J, 2011, INT J CLIMATOL, V31, P1596, DOI 10.1002/JOC.2183.;CHABOUREAU JP, 2012, Q J ROY METEOR SOC, V138, P596, DOI 10.1002/QJ.960.;COHUET JB, 2011, ATMOS RES, V100, P603, DOI 10.1016/J.ATMOSRES.2010.11.002.;CRESSMAN G.

314,Dar Mh;Chakravorty R;Waza Sa;Sharma M;Zaidi Nw;Singh An;Singh Us;Ismail Am,Transforming rice cultivation in flood prone coastal odisha to ensure food and economic security,FOOD SECURITY,"Flash floods leading to complete submergence of rice plants for 10-15 days is one of the major constraints for rice production, mainly in rainfed lowland areas. In india, 30\% of the rice growing area (12-14 m ha) is prone to flash flooding with average productivity of only 0.5-0.8 t ha(-1). Coastal odisha is one of the most flood prone areas of india where the paddy crop in the wet season is often devastated by flash floods, forcing farmers either to discontinue paddy cultivation or to revert to traditional varieties with very low yields. The flood tolerant variety, swarna-sub1 (ss1), was introduced through cluster demonstrations in some villages of the bari block of odisha in 2013. Ss1 seeds were provided to 355 farmers in two villages affected by floods twice in 2013. The majority of the farmers cultivated ss1 in 2013 and about 75\% of them persisted with the variety in 2014. There has been a steady and significant increase in paddy cultivation and yields per unit area between 2012 and 2014 and a sharp increase in paddy sales during 2013 and 2014. The present study showed that farmers preferred to cultivate low yielding traditional land races owing to their better flood tolerance and the unavailability of flood tolerant high yielding varieties (hyvs). Traditional varieties gave 30-42\% higher yields than non-ss1 hyvs when flooding occurred. Ss1 on the other hand offered a significant yield advantage of about twice that of traditional varieties, in both flooding and non-flooding years. There is an additional social advantage of ssi in that famers belonging to scheduled castes in flood prone villages, have greater numbers of plots that are exposed to prolonged floods. Thus they benefit proportionately more from the introduction of ss1.",FLOODING TOLERANCE; GRAIN YIELD; HIGH YIELDING RICE VARIETIES; SWARNA-SUB1; TRADITIONAL VARIETIES,SUBMERGENCE TOLERANCE; VARIETIES; DROUGHT; LOCUS; QTLS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,7,"ADKINS SW, 1990, PHYSIOL PLANTARUM, V80, P642, DOI 10.1034/J.1399-3054.1990.800423.X.;BAILEY S.

Vincent and the grenadines,GEOJOURNAL,"St. Vincent and the grenadines is an archipelagic state of the caribbean that regularly suffers natural disasters, climate change is increasing the frequency of intense hurricanes and storms. The southernmost watersheds of st. Vincent have a rugged topography that favours flash-flooding in rainy events, with great damage because the area concentrates most of the country's population and infrastructure. To deal with this problem the government has developed studies, engineering works and a watershed management plan. Land use management is an effective way of controlling hydrological impacts, the plan divides the watersheds in three uses, nature conservation (46\%), agriculture and agroforestry (24\%), and urban (30\%), with categories, establishing permitted, prohibited and restricted activities. The area is close to the limit of urban development, if further expansion were essential it should be done by increasing density in lower and flatter areas. Many houses, usually low-income settlements, are in flooding or landslide risk areas, which should be decolonized, changing land use. It is also necessary to avoid hillside arable crops. Adaptation to climate change through land use management is essential, although unfortunately less socially and politically appreciated than engineering works.",CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION; ST.

146,Jubach R;Tokar As,"International severe weather and flash flood hazard early warning systems-leveraging coordination, cooperation, and partnerships through a hydrometeorological project in southern africa",WATER,"Climate, weather and water hazards do not recognize national boundaries. Transboundary/regional programs and cooperation are essential to reduce the loss of lives and damage to livelihoods when facing these hazards. The development and implementation of systems to provide early warnings for severe weather events such as cyclones and flash floods requires data and information sharing in real time, and coordination among the government agencies at all levels. Within a country, this includes local, municipal, provincial-to-national levels as well as regional and international entities involved in hydrometeorological services and disaster risk reduction (drr). Of key importance are the national meteorological and hydrologic services (nmhss). The nmhs is generally the authority solely responsible for issuing warnings for these hazards. However, in many regions of the world, the linkages and interfaces between the nmhs and other agencies are weak or non-existent. Therefore, there is a critical need to assess, strengthen, and formalize collaborations when addressing the concept of reducing risk and impacts from severe weather and floods. The u.s. Agency for international development/office of u.s. Foreign disaster assistance, the united nations world meteorological organization (wmo), the wmo southern africa regional specialized meteorological center, hosted by the south african weather service, the u.s. National oceanic and atmospheric administration/national weather service and the hydrologic research center (a non-profit corporation) are currently implementing a project working with southern africa nmhss on addressing this gap. The project aims to strengthen coordination and collaboration mechanisms from national to local levels. The project partners are working with the nmhss to apply and implement appropriate tools and infrastructure to enhance currently operational severe weather and flash flood early warning systems in each country in support of delivery and communication of warnings for the drr entities at the regional, national and local levels in order to reduce the loss of life and property.",EARLY WARNING; HYDROMETEOROLOGICAL HAZARDS; SEVERE WEATHER; FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE; DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,4,"[ANONYMOUS], 2014, 1132 WMO.;CARPENTER TM, 1999, J HYDROL, V224, P21, DOI 10.1016/S0022-1694(99)00115-8.;GEORGAKAKOS K, 2013, 9 HRC.;GEORGAKAKOS KP, 2006, J HYDROL, V317, P81, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2005.05.009.;GRAHAM R., 2015, FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE, V5.;GUHA-SAPIR D., 2016, EM DAT INT DISASTER.;RELIEFWEB, 2015, SO AFR FLOODS JAN 20.;ROGERS D., 2011, IMPLEMENTING HAZARD.;THE UNIVERSITY CORPORATION FOR ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH, 2010, FLASH FLOOD EARL WAR.;*UN INT STRAT DIS, 2006, 3 INT C EARL WARN BO.","JUBACH, R (REPRINT AUTHOR), HYDROL RES CTR, 12555 HIGH BLUFF DR, SAN DIEGO, CA 92130 USA.;JUBACH, ROBERT, HYDROL RES CTR, 12555 HIGH BLUFF DR, SAN DIEGO, CA 92130 USA.;TOKAR, A.

In order to effectively prevent flash flood disasters, the state council approved the national flash flood control planning (nffcp) in 2006. In this planning, non-structural measures are recommended as the first step to be adopted in the prevention of flash floods, debris flow and landslide disasters caused by heavy rainfall. In order to effectively build up a comprehensive non-structural measure system for flash flood disaster prevention, the ministry of water resources has asked the local authorities to conduct studies in 103 pilot counties aiming to explore practical schemes. Based on the experience from these pilot counties, the construction of non-structural measures on flash flood disaster prevention for 1836 counties was officially initiated in 2010. The contents of non-structural measures for flash flood disaster prevention at county level include eight aspects.

The research to date shows a considerable potential of nbs to address the current challenges related to climate change and geo-hydrological risks. Despite significant interest in nbs by researchers and practitioners, knowledge concerning their practical implementation, monitoring, and evaluation is still lacking. This is particularly true for large-scale nbs. The present paper discusses how such solutions can be implemented in the context of hydro-meteorological risk reduction in small mediterranean catchments with a strong tourist vocation. The work presented here is situated within the reconect project (regenerating ecosystems with nature-based solutions for hydro-meteorological risk reduction), which aims to contribute to a european reference framework on nbs by demonstrating, upscaling, and replicating large-scale nbs in rural and natural areas. The italian case study of reconect is the portofino natural regional park, which represents a unique natural landscape element with high ecologic, social, and economic (touristic) value, which is threatened by a range of geo-hydrological hazards, such as flash floods, hyper-concentrated floods, shallow landslides, rockfalls, and storm surges. This paper also presents details of nbs interventions in two pilot catchments (san fruttuoso and paraggi) visited by thousands of tourists throughout the year. It addresses some of the key aspects related to monitoring meteorological and hydrological processes, as well as remote sensing activities (i.e., lidar surveys), which are necessary for the identification of critical-instability areas along waterways and the reconstruction of dry stone walls. Lastly, a discussion of relevant mitigation and adaptation strategies that are potentially replicable at national and international levels is also provided.",NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS; HYDRO-METEOROLOGICAL RISK REDUCTION; PORTOFINO NATURAL REGIONAL PARK; LIGURIA; ITALY,FLOOD RISK; CO-BENEFITS; SEA-STORM; FRAMEWORK; SERVICES; HERITAGE; LIGURIA; HAZARDS; EXAMPLE; EVENTS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"FACCINI, F (REPRINT AUTHOR), CNR, IST RIC PROTEZ IDROGEOL, STR CACCE 73, I-10135 TURIN, ITALY.;FACCINI, F (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV GENOA, DIPARTIMENTO SCI TERRA AMBIENTE \& VITA, CORSO EUROPA 26, I-16132 GENOA, ITALY.;CASAZZA, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), PARTHENOPE UNIV NAPLES, DEPT ENGN, VIA AMM F ACTON 38, I-80133 NAPLES, ITALY.;TURCONI, LAURA, FACCINI, FRANCESCO, PALIAGA, GUIDO, LUINO, FABIO, CNR, IST RIC PROTEZ IDROGEOL, STR CACCE 73, I-10135 TURIN, ITALY.;FACCINI, FRANCESCO, UNIV GENOA, DIPARTIMENTO SCI TERRA AMBIENTE \& VITA, CORSO EUROPA 26, I-16132 GENOA, ITALY.;MARCHESE, ALESSANDRA, GISIG, VIA PIACENZA 54, I-16138 GENOA, ITALY.;CASAZZA, MARCO, PARTHENOPE UNIV NAPLES, DEPT ENGN, VIA AMM F ACTON 38, I-80133 NAPLES, ITALY.;VOJINOVIC, ZORAN, IHE DELFT INST WATER EDUC, WESTVEST 7, NL-2611 AX DELFT, NETHERLANDS.",10.3390/SU12031240,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,EUROPEAN UNION'S HORIZON 2020 RESEARCH AND INNOVATION PROGRAM [776866],,,3,,MDPI,12,2020,ISI000524899604021,67,"SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY",2,"GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES",LAURA.TURCONIIRPI.CNR.IT FACCINIUNIGE.IT A.MARCHESEGISIG.IT GUIDO.PALIAGAIRPI.CNR.IT MARCO.CASAZZAUNIPARTHENOPE.IT Z.VOJINOVICUN-IHE.ORG FABIO.LUINOIRPI.CNR.IT,,LB8SF,,"FACCINI, F (REPRINT AUTHOR), CNR, IST RIC PROTEZ IDROGEOL, STR CACCE 73, I-10135 TURIN, ITALY",ISI,CNR;UNIV GENOA;MARCHESE;PARTHENOPE UNIV NAPLES;IHE DELFT INST WATER EDUC,CNR,,"TURCONI L, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY","TURCONI L, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY",FALSE,1,4_6,0,0,0,6,15,2,5
359,Kumar A;Gupta Ak;Bhambri R;Verma A;Tiwari Sk;Asthana Akl,Assessment and review of hydrometeorological aspects for cloudburst and flash flood events in the third pole region (indian himalaya),POLAR SCIENCE,"Impacts of global climate change can be seen worldwide, both on developing and developed economies. In recent years, numerous researches have been carried out by the government and non-government agencies in understanding, assessing, predicting, and responding to expected processes of global climate change and recommend policies for mitigation. Extreme weather events like increased precipitation, cloudbursts, flashfloods, and avalanches in the mountainous region threaten human lives, and state and national economies. In the indian himalayan region (ihr), well distributed hydrometeorological records (contemporary and historical) that facilitate the understanding of processes driving extreme weather events are scarce or rarely available. However, the capacity to observe, measure and quantify precipitation on regional scales has increased tremendously over the last three decades. Topography of the ihr provides favorable conditions for the cloudburst phenomenon which lead to frequent flashfloods and landslides, killing hundreds of people every year. Understanding the exact mechanism of the driving processes of cloudbursts such as orographic lifting, precipitation distribution, precipitation thresholds and its source or origin are still uncertain. Keeping in view that cloudbursts have been increasing in both their frequency and intensity, they are likely to intensify in the near future. Present study analyzes and critically summarizes facts and impacts of cloudburst events through compilation of hydrometeorological records and analysis of available data in the ihr. Results indicate that natural climate variability has played a much greater role in driving these extreme events than earlier thought. A general consensus is observed about the role of climate change, large atmospheric circulations, teleconnections and landuse-land-cover changes in driving these events.

While in the open literature ample attention is given to these climate change-associated effects in deltas and in the lowlands near the sea, less information is available about how people in the mountains experience and adapt to the changing mountainous climate. Climate variation exists in a long country as vietnam bordered by an over 3000-km-long coast. Therefore this chapter overviews the changing climate in the wider geographical context of both study areas: the 6 coastal provinces of north central vietnam and the 15 provinces of the northern mountainous region. The first part of this regional approach describes core climate aspects as temperature and wet precipitation along the coast of central vietnam. This is followed by the phenomenology of storms, flash floods, droughts, and landslides. This section is concluded with an analysis of the vulnerability of the six main sectors in this area: agri-and aquaculture, forestry, industry, tourism, and the dense population living here. The second part of this chapter aims at a similar approach adapted to the mountains in the northern part of the country.

450,Wu Hl;Cheng Wc;Shen Sl;Lin My;Arulrajah A,"Variation of hydro-environment during past four decades with underground sponge city planning to control flash floods in wuhan, china: an overview",UNDERGROUND SPACE,"This paper presents a review of the variation in the hydro-environment over the past four decades in wuhan, china, and discusses its close relationship with flash flood events. These flash flood events have inundated underground infrastructures and resulted in significant economic losses and casualties, which are also discussed in relation to various external and internal factors. The external factors are predominantly owing to heavy rainstorms resulting from extreme climate change. The internal factors predominantly include a decrease in wetland areas, changes in topography, and disrepair of drainage systems in urban areas. Since the 1970s, lakes in wuhan have been significantly reduced in size (by approximately 40\%). This reduction in wetland area decreases the water storage capacity in urban areas, and the frequency of large flooding events thus increased from 0.1 event/year to approximately 0.2 event/year. Additionally, the disrepair of drainage systems in urban areas has reduced their ability to resist flood hazards. Changes in topography have also intensified the flood volume per unit time, further burdening the drainage systems. In 2016, wuhan suffered from several large flooding events that led to some of the most severe economic losses in recorded history. The drainage system at the urban center of wuhan and proposed flood prevention methods are discussed in detail in this paper. The sponge city (spc) concept has been attempted in qingshan district, wuhan, and its success proved the reliability of the theory. A spc is believed to reduce the impacts of future flash floods in china and other developed and developing countries. (C) 2020 tongji university and tongji university press.

505,Dash P;Punia M,"Governance and disaster: analysis of land use policy with reference to uttarakhand flood 2013, india",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,"The flood risks are crucially increasing in developing countries around the globe due to intense development activities and climate change. The extreme casualties and losses wrought by the flood events in june 2013 in the uttarakhand (india) have raised the governance issues in policy-making and implementation for controlling human activities. Besides extreme rainfall, the unplanned development, weak legal framework and governance issues were claimed as responsible for triggering the disaster. The present study has evaluated the environmental aspects of existing policies related to regulate land use change and development activities when considered in relation to flooding. Analyzing the governance perspective by addressing policy, guidelines and mitigation strategies, this study highlighted the gaps in policies and practice that could be reshaped to reinforce resilience. This study also tried to delineate the high flood level and flood risk area along the bhagirathi river using hydrological and hydrodynamic models for the event of 2013 that can assist in policy-making process. In summary, the study found that rampant construction at riverside in absence of effective building regulations and hydropower policy in the state has increased the magnitude of the disaster. The lack of multi-institutional coordination in formulating and practice of regulatory measures was found as a failure of governance in disaster preparedness and flood management. This study strongly suggests for compliance of local planning authorities and stakeholders with state and national policymakers for establishing collaborative governance.

302,Casteel Ma;Downing Jr,How individuals process nws weather warning messages on their cell phones,WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY,"U.s. Government officials are focusing their attention on how to deliver timely and effective warning information to the public, especially given the devastating weather-related events that have occurred in recent years. With the increase of cell phones (and in particular, web-capable smartphones), weather warnings sent through various cellular technologies represent one way for officials to quickly notify an increasingly mobile public. Cellular technology innovations also make it possible for officials to broadcast information-rich media like graphics to cell phones. Whether warning messages must include such ``rich'' media to be effective remains an open question. The current study investigates the effectiveness of national weather service (nws) warning messages sent either in plain text or in text that includes a radar image of the storm. The research protocol was modeled after the interactive national weather service (inws) messaging service currently available to nws core partners. In the study, participants read full-text nws warnings of tornadoes or flash floods that either did or did not include a radar image of the storm. The researchers timed participants' ability to decide if a critical town was in the warning area, and then probed their understanding of the message content. Results show that participants' decision times to the town question did not differ between the graphic and no-graphic conditions. None of the other message content measures differed as a function of message condition. The results have potential implications for the federal government's new wireless emergency alert (wea) system, which, as yet, is limited to text-only warnings.",,UNCERTAINTY; TORNADO,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,13,"BROAD K, 2007, B AM METEOROL SOC, V88, P651, DOI 10.1175/BAMS-88-5-651.;CTIA, CITED 2011 WIRELESS.;DRABEK TE, 1971, J APPL SOC PSYCHOL, V1, P187, DOI 10.1111/J.1559-1816.1971.TB00362.X.;DRABEK TE, 1999, SOC SCI J, V36, P515, DOI 10.1016/S0362-3319(99)00021-X.;FCC, 2008, FCC REP FCC 08 184.;FCC, 2013, FCC ORDER DA 13 280.;FIEDRICH F, 2007, COMMUN ACM, V50, P41, DOI 10.1145/1226736.1226763.;GERBER M., CITED 2012 INTEGRATE.;GFK, 2006, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC.;GIZICKI A., CITED 2012 NWS TO ST.;GOLDEN JOSEPH H., 2000, NAT HAZARDS REV, V1, P107, DOI DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)1527-6988(2000)1:2(107).;GOOD.IWARE LTD, 2010, GOODREADER FOR IPHON.;HAMMER B, 2002, WEATHER FORECAST, V17, P577, DOI 10.1175/1520-0434(2002)017<0577:RTWDTM>2.0.CO,2.;HAUSFELD S, 1981, J EDUC PSYCHOL, V73, P312, DOI 10.1037/0022-0663.73.3.312.;HEGARTY M., 2009, CARTOGRAPHICA, V44, P171, DOI DOI 10.3138/CARTO.44.3.171.;HEGARTY M, 2010, J EXP PSYCHOL LEARN, V36, P37, DOI 10.1037/A0017683.;JACKS E., 2011, PREPRINTS CONF ON WE.;JOSLYN SL, 2009, APPL COGNITIVE PSYCH, V23, P55, DOI 10.1002/ACP.1449.;LOTT N., BILLION DOLLAR U S W.;MEYER DE, 1988, BIOL PSYCHOL, V26, P3, DOI 10.1016/0301-0511(88)90013-0.;MILETI DS, 2000, J HAZARD MATER, V75, P181, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3894(00)00179-5.;MILETI DS, 1991, SOCIOLOGICAL PRACTIC, V2, P20.;MITCHELL H.

14,Creutin Jd;Borga M;Lutoff C;Scolobig A;Ruin I;Creton-Cazanave L,Catchment dynamics and social response during flash floods: the potential of radar rainfall monitoring for warning procedures,METEOROLOGICAL APPLICATIONS,"The objective of this paper is to examine how current techniques for flash-flood monitoring and forecasting can meet the needs of the population at risk to evaluate the flood severity and anticipate its danger. To this end, the social response time for different social actions in the course of two well studied flash flood events which occurred ill france and italy is identified. The event management activities are broadly characterized into three types according to their main objective (information, organisation and protection). The activities are also classified into three other types according, to the scale and nature of the human group involved (individuals, communities and institutions). The conclusions reached relate to (1) the characterisation of the social responses according to watershed scale and to the information available, and (2) to the appropriateness of the existing surveillance and forecasting tools to support the social responses. Results suggest that representing the dynamics of the social response with just one number representing the average time for warning a population is an oversimplification. It appears that the social response time exhibits a parallel with the hydrological response time by diminishing in time with decreasing size of the relevant watershed. A second result is that the human groups have different capabilities of anticipation, apparently based oil the nature of information they use. Comparing watershed response times and social response times shows clearly that at scales of less than 100 km(2), a number of actions were taken with response times comparable to the catchment response time. The implications for adapting the warning processes to social scales (individual or organisational scales) are considerable. At small scales, and for the implied anticipation times. The reliable and high-resolution description of the actual rainfall field becomes the major source of information for decision-making processes such as deciding between evacuations or advising to stay home. This points to the need to improve the accuracy and quality control of real time radar rainfall data, especially for extreme flash flood-generating storms.

381,Wei L;Hu K;Hu X,Rainfall occurrence and its relation to flood damage in china from 2000 to 2015,JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE,"China is highly susceptible to flood disasters and subjected to great damage every year. Furthermore, the flood frequency has exhibited an increasing trend in recent years. Most flood events, including flash floods and river flood, are induced by rainfall. This study investigates annual variations of rainfall occurrence over china during the period from 2000 to 2015 at the national and regional scale using daily rainfall data from the tropical rainfall measuring mission. The mann-kendall test is performed for trend detection, and statistical data of flood damage published by china's government, including destroyed crop area, damaged buildings, direct economic loss, percentage of gdp (gross domestic product), and death toll are correlatively analysed with rainfall occurrences. The results show that storm rain events show the greatest variation among three rainfall types (moderate rain, heavy rain and storm rain). The variation coefficients of rainfall over northeast china, north china, and northwest china are the highest, whereas that for southwest china is the smallest. Moderate rain, heavy rain over central china, and moderate rain over southwest china exhibits decreasing trends, whereas the remaining exhibit increasing trends. The correlation between the rainfall occurrences and these flood damage indices at the national scale shows that only direct economic loss has a strong positive correlation with rainfall occurrences, and the other indices have weaker correlations. The correlation is strong in three north regions, except for death toll in northwest china. In contrast, the correlation between flood damage and rainfall is weak in east china, central china, southwest china, and south china. Overall, death toll is strongly correlated with the number of damaged buildings, implying that flood fatalities in china are likely associated with building collapse, and are dominated by specific extreme events. This study can provide a scientific reference for flood management in china.",FLOOD DAMAGE; RAINFALL OCCURRENCE; STORM RAINFALL; COEFFICIENT OF VARIATION,MULTISATELLITE PRECIPITATION ANALYSIS; RIVER-BASIN; TRMM; APPLICABILITY; MANAGEMENT; DISASTERS; EXTREMES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"[ANONYMOUS], 2015, HUM COST WEATH REL D.;[ANONYMOUS], 2007, CLIM CHANG 2007 SYNT.;[ANONYMOUS], 2015, WORLD DIS REP FOC LO.;BRACKEN LJ, 2008, HYDROL PROCESS, V22, P683, DOI 10.1002/HYP.6641.;CHEN S, 2013, NAT HAZARDS, V69, P1597, DOI 10.1007/S11069-013-0765-0.;CHI XX, 2016, THEOR APPL CLIMATOL, V124, P555, DOI 10.1007/S00704-015-1436-8.;DOMROES M, 1988, THE CLIMATE OF CHINA.;DONMEZ S, 2017, NAT HAZARDS, V88, P1.;DU WW, 2013, 9 ANN INT C INT I IN.;DU XD, 2015, J GEOGR SCI, V25, P387, DOI 10.1007/S11442-015-1175-X.;DUAN WL, 2016, NAT HAZARDS, V82, P401, DOI 10.1007/S11069-016-2207-2.;FERREIRA S, 2011, P 2011 GEORG WAT RES.;FISCHER T, 2012, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V110, P783, DOI 10.1007/S10584-011-0123-8.;HARRIS A, 2007, SENSORS-BASEL, V7, P3416, DOI 10.3390/S7123416.;HU H.Y., 1935, ACTA GEOGRAPHICA SIN, V2, P33, DOI DOI 10.11821/XB193502002.;HU KH, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P2209, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-2209-2012.;HUFFMAN GJ, 2007, J HYDROMETEOROL, V8, P38, DOI 10.1175/JHM560.1.;HUFFMAN GJ, 2015, INTEGRATED MULTISATE.;INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE (IPCC), 2001, CLIM CHANG 2001 IMP.;JI YH, 2015, NAT HAZARDS, V77, P1853, DOI 10.1007/S11069-015-1679-9.;JOYCE RJ, 2004, J HYDROMETEOROL, V5, P487, DOI 10.1175/1525-7541(2004)005<0487:CAMTPG>2.0.CO,2.;KENDALL MG, 1975, RANK CORRELATION MET.;KNOX JC, 1993, NATURE, V361, P430, DOI 10.1038/361430A0.;LI D, 2018, J HYDROL, V556, P1139, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2017.01.006.;LI L, 2009, NAT HAZARDS, V50, P109, DOI 10.1007/S11069-008-9324-5.;LI Z, 2015, SPATIAL TEMPORAL VAR.;[ LIU JUNFENG], 2010, [, ADVANCES IN WATER SCIENCE], V21, P343.;[ LIU SHAOHUA], 2016, [, ADVANCES IN WATER SCIENCE], V27, P639.;[ LUO SAN], 2011, [, METEOROLOGICAL MONTHLY], V37, P1081.;MA JM, 2010, IRRIG DRAIN, V59, P17, DOI 10.1002/IRD.513.;MANN HB, 1945, ECONOMETRICA, V13, P245, DOI 10.2307/1907187.;MERZ B, 2010, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V10, P1697, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-10-1697-2010.;NICHOLLS N, 2001, NAT HAZARDS, V23, P137, DOI 10.1023/A:1011130223164.;PAPAGIANNAKI K, 2015, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V3, P3119.;PIELKE RA, 2000, J CLIMATE, V13, P3625, DOI 10.1175/1520-0442(2000)013<3625:PADFTI>2.0.CO,2.;QIN DH, 2015, CHINAS CLIMATE EXTRE.;TEKELI AE, 2016, J HYDROL, V541, P471, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2016.01.014.;[ WANG ZHAOLI], 2017, [, ADVANCES IN WATER SCIENCE], V28, P174.;WENTZ FJ, 2007, SCIENCE, V317, P233, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.1140746.;WOBUS C, 2014, J FLOOD RISK MANAG, V7, P217, DOI 10.1111/JFR3.12043.;WU CH, 2015, INT J CLIMATOL, V35, P2978, DOI 10.1002/JOC.4187.;[ YANG JINHU], 2008, [, CLIMATIC AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH], V13, P75.;YANG N, 2017, J HYDROL, V549, P313, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2017.04.006.;YANG YM, 2017, NAT HAZARDS, V87, P1489, DOI 10.1007/S11069-017-2836-0.;ZHAI PM, 1999, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V42, P203, DOI 10.1023/A:1005428602279.;ZHAO BL, 2001, J METEOROL SOC JPN, V79, P301, DOI 10.2151/JMSJ.79.301.;ZHU HL, 2018, ATMOS RES, V207, P28, DOI 10.1016/J.ATMOSRES.2018.02.022.","HU, KH (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHINESE ACAD SCI, KEY LAB MT HAZARDS \& EARTH SURFACE PROC, CHENGDU 610041, SICHUAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.;HU, KH (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHINESE ACAD SCI, INST MT HAZARDS \& ENVIRONM, CHENGDU 610041, SICHUAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.;WEI, LI, HU, KAI-HENG, HU, XU-DONG, CHINESE ACAD SCI, KEY LAB MT HAZARDS \& EARTH SURFACE PROC, CHENGDU 610041, SICHUAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.;WEI, LI, HU, KAI-HENG, HU, XU-DONG, CHINESE ACAD SCI, INST MT HAZARDS \& ENVIRONM, CHENGDU 610041, SICHUAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.;WEI, LI, HU, XU-DONG, UNIV CHINESE ACAD SCI, BEIJING 100049, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.1007/S11629-018-4931-4,"16 DONGHUANGCHENGGEN NORTH ST, BEIJING 100717, PEOPLES R CHINA",,"NATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINA (973 PROGRAM)NATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINA [2015CB452704]; NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [41371039]; EXTERNAL COOPERATION PROGRAM OF BIC, CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES [131551KYSB20130003]",,1672-6316,11,2492-2504,SCIENCE PRESS,15,2018,ISI000450458300013,47,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,8,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES,WEILIIMDE.AC.CN KHHUIMDE.AC.CN 83514768QQ.COM,,HA7JV,,"HU, KH (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHINESE ACAD SCI, KEY LAB MT HAZARDS \& EARTH SURFACE PROC, CHENGDU 610041, SICHUAN, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,CHINESE ACAD SCI;INST MT HAZARDS AND ENVIRONM;UNIV CHINESE ACAD SCI,CHINESE ACAD SCI,,"WEI L, 2018, J MT SCI","WEI L, 2018, J MT SCI",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0,1_2_6,1_11_13,0,2
541,Blumenthal B;Nyberg L,The impact of intense rainfall on insurance losses in two swedish cities,JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT,"While a major part of previous research in the field of flood damage has focused on water depth as the most important causal factor, little attention has been paid to the role of rainfall intensity. As a test, this paper used correlation and regression analyses to investigate rainfall intensity as a factor affecting flood damage. For a time period of 15 years, the relationship between insurance losses caused by floods and rainfall intensity data from rain gauges was examined in two swedish cities. Another objective was to find an approach for damage functions based on rainfall intensity as explanatory variable. Using linear regression, two approaches with considerable high degrees of explanation were found-one based on an exponential function and one on a power function. Using a lower limit for rainfall intensity, the approaches reached degrees of explanation between 30 and 78\%. From this study it was concluded that rainfall intensity during the summer months and the occurrence of insurance damages per day caused by floods were correlated and further that rainfall intensity has a great potential to explain urban flood damages. In the future, additional studies are needed to validate the proposed methods and integrate other flood damage affecting factors in the approach.",FLASH FLOOD; FLOOD DAMAGE; FLOOD DAMAGE FUNCTION; INSURED FLOOD LOSS; RAINFALL INTENSITY; URBAN FLOOD,DAMAGE; PRECIPITATION; DATABASE; FRAMEWORK; FLOODS; RADAR,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"BLUMENTHAL, B (REPRINT AUTHOR), KARLSTAD UNIV, RISK \& ENVIRONM STUDIES, KARLSTAD, SWEDEN.;BLUMENTHAL, BARBARA, NYBERG, LARS, KARLSTAD UNIV, RISK \& ENVIRONM STUDIES, KARLSTAD, SWEDEN.;BLUMENTHAL, BARBARA, NYBERG, LARS, KARLSTAD UNIV, CTR CLIMATE \& SAFETY, KARLSTAD, SWEDEN.",10.1111/JFR3.12504,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,STIFTELSEN LANSFORSAKRINGSBOLAGENS FORSKNINGSFOND,,1753-318X,2,,WILEY,12,2019,ISI000492052900020,38,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, WATER RESOURCES",2,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",BARBARA.BLUMENTHALKAU.SE,,JG4OD,,"BLUMENTHAL, B (REPRINT AUTHOR), KARLSTAD UNIV, RISK \& ENVIRONM STUDIES, KARLSTAD, SWEDEN",ISI,KARLSTAD UNIV;KARLSTAD UNIV,KARLSTAD UNIV,,"BLUMENTHAL B, 2019, J FLOOD RISK MANAG","BLUMENTHAL B, 2019, J FLOOD RISK MANAG",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,2,1_11_13,1,2
418,Achawakorn K;Raksa K;Kongkalai N,Flash flood warning system using scada system: laboratory level,2014 INTERNATIONAL ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING CONGRESS (IEECON),"Flash flood is one of the natural disasters that cause severe damage in many parts around the world. The large numbers of villager who reside along the stream side suffer by losing their accommodations, properties, and life. The reason that made flash flood very dangerous is abruptly happening with no proper warning. The flash flood and landslide warning system are developed to forecast and warn the citizens who live in the risky area. Various criteria are selected under the meteorology theory. This research focuses on measuring the varying of the water level and flow rate of the stream. Sets of sensors are going to be installed along the stream located from the upper stream to the village area. The sensors node has been developed to measure the interesting data. It able to work as a standalone self-powered by photovoltaic cell and as a remote terminal of sensor network system. Each node consists of local controller which is able to process the raw data and the communication module which is functioned to send the information to the server. The industrial control system scada (supervisory control and data acquisition) system is selected to work as a central control program of the warning system. The hmi (human machine interface) is designed based on the contour map of the interest area. The developed system has been tested in two phrases the standalone sensor node and the network test. The laboratory results show that the system able to measure the level precisely and real-time. Each of remote terminals can utilize the power generated by photovoltaic cell sufficiently.

361,Masoud Mhz;Basahi Jm;Rajmohan N,"Impact of flash flood recharge on groundwater quality and its suitability in the wadi baysh basin, western saudi arabia: an integrated approach",ENVIRONMENTAL EARTH SCIENCES,"An integrated approach was used to evaluate the impact of flash flood recharge on groundwater quality and its suitability for drinking, irrigation, livestock and poultry uses in the wadi baysh basin, western saudi arabia. Analyses of 182 groundwater samples, collected from the study area before and after a flash flood (ff) event, show that the average concentrations of tds, mg, na, cl, no3 and ec decreased significantly after the event. The major water types (mixed camgcl, nacl and cacl) indicate that the infiltration of surface water from ff recharge has a great influence on groundwater chemistry. Drinking water suitability maps, created using who standards, indicate that wells located in the upstream region are suitable for drinking despite their high tds and total hardness (th) values. Groundwater in the coastal region is unsuitable due to its high salinity, high th and high concentrations of major ions. The suitability of groundwater for irrigational use was assessed using salinity, sodium adsorption ratio, bicarbonate hazard, residual sodium carbonate, kelly's ratio, magnesium hazard, sodium percentage and permeability index values, which indicated that groundwater in the study region is suitable for most soils and crops. After ff, groundwater quality is improved by dilution, especially in the downstream region. Ussl classification shows that the majority of the water samples are in the c3s1, c4s2, and c3s2 classes and are therefore suitable for the irrigation of salt-tolerant crops. Irrigational suitability maps suggest that wells in the upstream region are suitable for irrigation, whereas wells located near to the coast are unfit for irrigation. This study implies that construction of check dams in the dry valleys (wadies) may improve the groundwater quality in the area.",GROUNDWATER QUALITY; IRRIGATION; DRINKING; LIVESTOCK; FLASH FLOOD; BAYSH BASIN; SAUDI ARABIA,WATER-QUALITY; HYDROGEOCHEMICAL PROCESSES; ARID ENVIRONMENT; IRRIGATION; DRINKING; MANAGEMENT; AQUIFER; REGION; DESERT; INDIA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"ABDALLA F., 2014, EGYPT INT J GEOSCI, V5, P971, DOI DOI 10.4236/IJG.2014.59083.;ABDESSELAM S, 2013, ENVIRON EARTH SCI, V70, P2129, DOI 10.1007/S12665-012-1834-5.;ABULFATIH H.

While part 1 analyses the meteorological and hydrological situation, part 2 concentrates on the geomorphological aspects and damage to buildings. The study outlines the origin and amount of material that was mobilized and transported into the town by the flood, and analyses damage data collected for 96 affected buildings, describing the degree of impact, underlying processes, and building characteristics. Due to the potentially high sediment load of flash floods and their non-steady and non-uniform flow especially in built-up areas, the damaging processes differ from those of clear water floods.

Stanceni,"17TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE - THE KNOWLEDGE-BASED ORGANIZATION: APPLIED TECHNICAL SCIENCES AND ADVANCED MILITARY TECHNOLOGIES, CONFERENCE PROCEEDING 3","The present study focuses on the impact generated by flash floods within the mountain area of the mures hydrographic basin, namely by analyzing the data offered by the hydrographical station of stanceni regarding measurements of the hazards and the economical and environmental aspects. Thus, the study is directed towards the representative flash-floods that occurred during the years of 1970, 1975, 1995, 1998, and 2005. The comparative analysis of the hazard involves hydrograph reference regarding the largest floods to be recorded in the years of 1970, 1975, 1995, 1998, and 2005 in the upper river basin of mures, including the flow rates, the volumes transported, the growth and decay duration as well as reports to the total duration of the floods in the study. The vulnerability of the area is influenced by the population density, which is lower as compared to the plain area crossed by the river mures mainly in it's middle and lower sector, and the area's economical development. The effects of the major flash floods are reflected within the amount of damage caused in the studied area. The paper finally states the structural and non-structural measures that have been taken in order to reduce the impact that flash-floods have upon the upper side of the mures river basin, within the county of mures.",RISK ANALYSIS; FLASH FLOODS; STANCENI,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,"PANDI G., 2010, FLOOD WAVES INCLUDED, VII, P55.;PINE J.

This study aims to increase understanding of multi-hazard events in poorly documented regions with low accessibility. We focus on the nyamwamba catchment (107 km(2)) located in the rwenzori mountains (uganda) where on may 1, 2013, a severe flash flood occurred. In this region, wildfires, earthquakes and landslides occur as well. Here we reconstruct the circumstances under which this flash flood event was triggered, characterize the different processes acting upon the catchment dynamics and estimate the damaging effects of the flash flood within the catchment. The combined occurrence of intense rainfall, a forest fire having burned 18 \% of the catchment area and the occurrence of 29 landslides providing debris to the river system, induced a debris-rich and very destructive flash flood which caused several fatalities, the destruction of 70 buildings, several bridges, a hospital, a school, a tarmac road and several lifelines. Although the methodologies applied to estimate peak discharge, detect landslides and delineate wildfires are well established in their disciplines and sometimes limited in their precision, their combination is required to demonstrate the importance of the wildfire and landslides for the magnitude of this flood, unprecedented in decades but characterized by a low return period of the triggering rainfall event. This indicates that flash floods should not be considered as self-determined phenomena but as a result of several cascading and interacting hazard processes.",FLASH FLOOD; LANDSLIDE; FOREST FIRE; MULTI-HAZARD; EQUATORIAL AFRICA,DEBRIS FLOWS; LANDSLIDE; CHALLENGES; VOLCANISM; POSTFIRE; CLIMATE; IMPACT; ISLAND,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,15,"ACTALLIANCE, 2013, PREL APP UGANDA FLAS.;BARNES H, 1967, USGS SURV WATER SUPP, V219, P8.;BINEGO A, 2014, CAUSES RIVER NYAMWAM.;BRUNNER GW, 1995, COMP ONE DIMENSIONAL.;CATANE SG, 2012, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V169, P55, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2012.04.008.;CHENG JD, 2005, J HYDROL, V306, P161, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2004.09.007.;CHOW V.

27,O'hare G;Rivas S,"The landslide hazard and human vulnerability in la paz city, bolivia",GEOGRAPHICAL JOURNAL,"Landslides in the city of la paz, bolivia are complex in space and time. Their distribution within the city is differentiated by geographical variations in slope gradient, the nature of overlying surface deposits, and drainage density patterns. When mapped, the distribution of the most landslide-prone locations in the city coincides with the most mobile surface deposits on the higher and steeper slopes of the city. The timing of landslides is triggered when slope materials become saturated with moisture by rainfall, stream water, water seepage from high surrounding water tables, and from domestic sources. Landslide frequencies over the last 40 years show the role of inter-annual variations in summer rainfalls, especially the late summer period (jan-mar), and rising water tables connected to lake titicaca. Associations with enso events, both warm (el nino) and cold (la nina), prove negative, pointing to the importance of moisture sources from the north, south and east (amazon) but not from the west (pacific). The most vulnerable group exposed to the landslide hazard comprise the inhabitants of the self-built informal housing areas who occupy the more elevated steeper slopes of the northern part of the city. But societal vulnerability to earth movement in the city is widespread and interconnected. Higher income groups in the southern part of the city are affected by slower, if less dramatic, forms of land failure, and rich housing in downstream areas of the city are impacted by flash flooding encouraged by deforestation on the northern hill slopes where the poor live. Two case studies highlight the vulnerability and plight of the inhabitants of the self-built settlements in the aftermath of a major landslide, and a brief discussion of hazard mitigation and the importance of building hazard resilient communities concludes the paper.",BOLIVIA; LA PAZ; LANDSLIDES; HAZARDS; INFORMAL HOUSING; SELF-BUILT SETTLEMENTS; VULNERABILITY,RAINFALL; INDIA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,23,"AGARWAL B, 1990, J PEASANT STUD, V17, P341, DOI 10.1080/03066159008438426.;ALEXANDER DE, 2000, CONFRONTING CATASTRO.;ANDERSEN L.

47,Carmen Llasat M;Marcos R;Turco M;Gilabert J;Llasat-Botija M,Trends in flash flood events versus convective precipitation in the mediterranean region: the case of catalonia,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The aim of this paper is to analyse the potential relationship between flash flood events and convective precipitation in catalonia, as well as any related trends. The paper starts with an overview of flash floods and their trends in the mediterranean region, along with their associated factors, followed by the definition of, identification of, and trends in convective precipitation. After this introduction the paper focuses on the north-eastern iberian peninsula, for which there is a long-term precipitation series (since 1928) of 1-min precipitation from the fabra observatory, as well as a shorter (1996-2011) but more extensive precipitation series (43 rain gauges) of 5-min precipitation. Both series have been used to characterise the degree of convective contribution to rainfall, introducing the beta parameter as the ratio between convective precipitation versus total precipitation in any period. Information about flood events was obtained from the inungama database (a flood database created by the gama team), with the aim of finding any potential links to convective precipitation. These flood data were gathered using information on damage where flood is treated as a multifactorial risk, and where any trend or anomaly might have been caused by one or more factors affecting hazard, vulnerability or exposure. Trend analysis has shown an increase in flash flood events. The fact that no trends were detected in terms of extreme values, of precipitation on a daily scale, nor on the associated etccdi (expert team on climate change detection and indices) extreme index, could point to an increase in vulnerability, an increase in exposure, or changes in land use. However, the summer increase in convective precipitation was concentrated in less torrential events, which could partially explain this positive trend in flash flood events. The beta parameter has been also used to characterise the type of flood event according to the features of the precipitation. The highest values correspond to short and local events, usually with daily beta values above 0.5, while the minimum threshold of daily beta for catastrophic flash floods is 0.31.

104,Douvinet J;Delahaye D,Specificities and risk due to `flash floods' in the north of france (parisian basin),GEOMORPHOLOGIE-RELIEF PROCESSUS ENVIRONNEMENT,"The aim of this article is to review the current knowledge on flash floods occurring at the end of the spring or during the summer on the loamy plateaus of the parisian basin, in northwestern france. Classically named muddy floods', such hydrological hazards are significant as they cause losses of life and significant damage on buildings and infrastructures. However, they still remain poorly documented. We propose here to precise their characteristics by studying flash floods events i) at the local scale thanks to several systematic investigations on various catchments and ii) at the regional scale using a specific database recording 269 events on 189 catchments between 1983 and 2005. We focused on material and human damage but not on the main triggering factors that could explain their occurrence. Results highlight that these streamflows are characterized by sub-torrential dynamics, with high sediment contents and time-responses to high rainfalls (>50 nun in less than 15 h) of less than one hour. Most of the basins (<40 km(2)) are dry valleys, i.e., permanent stream-flow does not normally exist during normal periods. Diffusive runoff rapidly shifts to concentrated runoff, generating high-incised gullies over short distances. Erosive forms with a depth of several meters and a lateral extension exceeding 10 m are observed in compact loamy soils but the major incisions generally appear at the outlet of 1st- or 2nd-order basins. The morphological component explains this paradox. Because of high-slopes and a rapid steep sidedness, runoff energy compensates the low amount of water. Thalwegs of 3rd- or 4th-order basins are therefore more adapted to evacuate important discharges (weak slope, large channel). Consequently, they decrease the erosive capacity of streamflows. High specific discharges (ranging from 1 to 2 m(3).S(-1).Km(-2)) and high specific stream powers (from 22 to 511 w/m(2)) are linked to major morphogenic impacts on these small-sized basins. The final part of tins paper discusses the risk generated by flash floods on local population. If events and damage are rarely observed on similar catchments, they are frequent on a regional scale with 8 to 9 events observed per year in the studied areas.",FLASH FLOOD; DRY VALLEY; EFFICIENT RUNOFF; MORPHOLOGY; PARISIAN BASIN; FRANCE,CONCENTRATED FLOW EROSION; SOIL SURFACE-STATE; BELGIAN LOAM BELT; CROPPING SYSTEMS; RAINFALL EVENTS; MUDDY FLOODS; CATCHMENTS; RUNOFF; MORPHOLOGY; MAGNITUDE,FRENCH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,10,"ANGELIAUME A., 1994, HYDROLOGIE CONTINENTALE, V9, P107.;ANGELIAUME A, 1997, GEOMORPHOLOGIE, V2, P155.;ANTOINE J-M., 2001, ANN GEOGR, V110, P597.;ARNAUD-FASSETTA G., 2002, GEOMORPHOLOGIE, V1, P17.;ARNAUD-FASSETTA G., 2009, GEOMORPHOLOGIE, V2, P109.;AUZET AV, 1995, EARTH SURF PROC LAND, V20, P759, DOI 10.1002/ESP.3290200807.;BERNOT V, 1996, REV GEOGRAPHIE LYON, V4, P323.;BEUSELINCK L, 2000, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V32, P69, DOI 10.1016/S0169-555X(99)00068-9.;BLONG R, 2003, NAT HAZARDS, V29, P57, DOI 10.1023/A:1022960414329.;BOARDMAN J, 2003, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V6, P69, DOI 10.1016/S1462-9011(02)00125-9.;BOGAART PW, 2003, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V54, P257, DOI 10.1016/S0169-555X(02)00360-4.;BOIFFIN J, 1988, AGRONOMIE, V8, P663, DOI 10.1051/AGRO:19880801.;BORGA M, 2007, J HYDROMETEOROL, V8, P1049, DOI 10.1175/JHM593.1.;BRAVARD JP, 2001, GEOMORPHOLOGIE, V4, P257.;CARLING PA, 1996, ADV FLUVIAL DYNAMICS.;CERDAN O, 2002, SOIL TILL RES, V67, P99, DOI 10.1016/S0167-1987(02)00045-4.;DAUGE Y, 1999, POLITIQUES PUBLIQUES.;DELAHAYE D, 2003, B ASS GEOGRAPHES FRA, V3, P287.;DELAHAYE D, 1999, ETUDES NORMANDES, V1, P157.;DELAHAYE D, 2002, MEMOIRE HABILITATION.;DERCOLE R, 1994, REV GEOGR ALP, V4, P87.;DOUVINET J., 2008, THESIS U CAEN BASSE.;DOUVINET J, 2008, CLIMATOLOGI IN PRESS.;DOUVINET J., 2006, NOROIS, V201, P17.;DROBOT S.

293,Papagiannaki K;Lagouvardos K;Kotroni V;Bezes A,Flash flood occurrence and relation to the rainfall hazard in a highly urbanized area,NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"The paper examines the flash flood events that occurred over a decade in the attica prefecture, the most urbanized region of greece, with the aim of identifying triggering rainfall thresholds, as well as assessing the effect of rainfall upon the magnitude of the induced damages. The analysis incorporates rainfall records from a network of 28 surface meteorological stations and information on the spatial distribution of the flash flood events that is derived from the active database of damaging weather events maintained by the atmospheric modelling group of the national observatory of athens. The main findings concern firstly the relation between the flash flood impact, as measured by the fire service operations in flooded properties, and precipitation in various time intervals. In the period 2005-2014, 48 damaging flash flood events occurred in the target area and caused more than 3500 fire service operations in flooded properties. Most of the events are associated with maximum accumulated rainfall of more than 20mm in 24 h and 3mm in 10 min. However, the flash flood impact intensity, as measured by the number of the fire service operations per event, increases significantly above the levels of 60mm in 24 h and 10mm in 10 min. Secondly, graphs of rainfall intensity versus duration are developed for 15 sub-areas of attica in order to define rainfall intensity thresholds for flood triggering at a more local level. It is shown that conclusions regarding the reliability of the estimated thresholds should take into account the representativity of the rain gauges, which is determined by the local network's density, the gauges' location and record length.",,LIGHTNING DATA; SOCIAL IMPACT; DEBRIS FLOWS; THRESHOLDS; DATABASE; GREECE; UNDERSTAND; EVENTS; MEDEX; STORM,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,18,"AMARO J, 2010, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V10, P2643, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-10-2643-2010.;BARBERIA L, 2014, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V14, P1843, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-14-1843-2014.;BARBERIA L., 2011, PLIN C MED STORMS DI.;BARRERA-ESCODA A, 2015, HYDROL EARTH SYST SC, V19, P465, DOI 10.5194/HESS-19-465-2015.;BRACKEN LJ, 2008, HYDROL PROCESS, V22, P683, DOI 10.1002/HYP.6641.;BRODY SD, 2013, NAT HAZARDS REV, V14, P89, DOI [10.1061/(ASCE)NH.1527-6996.0000091, 10.1061/(ASCE)NH.1527-6996.8888891].;CANNON SH, 2008, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V96, P250, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2007.03.019.;CARPENTER TM, 1999, J HYDROL, V224, P21, DOI 10.1016/S0022-1694(99)00115-8.;CRED, 2009, DIS DAT BAL PERSP.;DIAKAKIS M, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V62, P485, DOI 10.1007/S11069-012-0090-Z.;DIAKAKIS M, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V60, P789, DOI 10.1007/S11069-011-9904-7.;DU SQ, 2015, NAT HAZARDS, V76, P1457, DOI 10.1007/S11069-014-1463-2.;EEA, 2010, 132010 EEA, DOI [10.2800/62638, DOI 10.2800/62638].;GAUME E, 2009, J HYDROL, V367, P70, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2008.12.028.;GEORGAKAKOS KP, 2006, J HYDROL, V317, P81, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2005.05.009.;GUZZETTI F, 2008, LANDSLIDES, V5, P3, DOI 10.1007/S10346-007-0112-1.;HAIC, 2015, NAT HAZ RIOTS GREEC.;JANSA A, 2014, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V14, P1965, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-14-1965-2014.;JONKMAN SN, 2005, NAT HAZARDS, V34, P151, DOI 10.1007/S11069-004-8891-3.;KANDILIOTI G, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V61, P441, DOI 10.1007/S11069-011-9930-5.;KOTRONI V, 1999, Q J ROY METEOR SOC, V125, P967, DOI 10.1256/SMSQJ.55510.;KOUSSIS AD, 2003, J HYDROL ENG, V8, P1, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)1084-0699(2003)8:1(1).;LAGOUVARDOS K, 2007, B AM METEOROL SOC, V88, P1363, DOI 10.1175/BAMS-88-9-1363.;LAGOUVARDOS K, 1996, J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS, V101, P26217, DOI 10.1029/96JD01385.;LASTORIA B., 2006, ADV GEOSCI, V7, P223, DOI DOI 10.5194/ADGE0-7-223-2006.;LLASAT MC, 2013, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V13, P1337, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-13-1337-2013.;LLASAT MC, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P1201, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-1201-2009.;LLASAT M.

415,Lincoln Ws;Thomason Rfl,A preliminary look at using rainfall average recurrence interval to characterize flash flood events for real-time warning forecasting,JOURNAL OF OPERATIONAL METEOROLOGY,"Characterization of flash flood severity in real-time has been highlighted by national weather service (nws) service assessments for almost two decades. Current flash flood warning techniques provide limited guidance on determining potential severity of flood impacts. Recent software updates allowing for the estimation of rainfall average recurrence intervals (aris) in real-time help improve the nowcasting of flash flood events, but guidance is lacking on specific aris to use as thresholds. Researchers at the nws lower mississippi river forecast center collected data for 24 flash flood events across the eastern united states. Reports of flash flooding were characterized based upon relative severity, and then matched to rainfall aris. Preliminary results from this study suggest that utilizing the 2-yr ari contour derived from 3-h rainfall would capture approximately 90\% of flash flood reports. It also was found that more significant flash flood impacts generally became more common with an increased 3-h rainfall ari, with major flooding of roadways or structures (>= 0.91 m, or 3 ft, of inundation) becoming likely by around a 25-yr max ari for the storm. Because of biases in the available cases used in the analysis, results are considered preliminary and subject to considerable case-by-case variability.",,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"BONNIN G.

Understanding flash flood characteristics is essential for mitigating the associated risks and implementing proactive risk management strategies. In this study, flash flood characteristics including frequency, duration, and intensity are assessed in addition to their associated property damages. The national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) storm events database as well as hourly precipitation data of the north american land data assimilation system project phase-2 (nldas-2) are utilised, and more than 14,000 flash flood events during 1996-2017 are analysed. Flash flood hazard is investigated at county, state, and regional levels across the seus. Results indicate increasing pattern for the frequency and intensity of flash flooding over the seus. The frequency of flash flooding is found to be higher in spring and summer, whereas the duration and intensity of events are higher during winter and fall, respectively. The western parts of the seus are prone to more frequent and intense flash flooding compared to the eastern parts. Overall, our analyses suggest that flash flood hazard in louisiana is higher than other states in the seus.",DURATION; FLASH FLOOD; FREQUENCY; HAZARD; INTENSITY,PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; EXTRATROPICAL TRANSITION; RAINFALL THRESHOLDS; NORTH-CAROLINA; MENTAL MODELS; CLIMATE; VULNERABILITY; STREAMFLOWS; PREDICTION; PARAMETERS,ENGLISH,"ARTICLE, EARLY ACCESS",ARTICLE,1,none,"ALIPOUR, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ALABAMA, DEPT CIVIL CONSTRUCT \& ENVIRONM ENGN, CTR COMPLEX HYDROSYST RES, TUSCALOOSA, AL 35487 USA.;ALIPOUR, ATIEH, AHMADALIPOUR, ALI, MORADKHANI, HAMID, UNIV ALABAMA, DEPT CIVIL CONSTRUCT \& ENVIRONM ENGN, CTR COMPLEX HYDROSYST RES, TUSCALOOSA, AL 35487 USA.",10.1111/JFR3.12605,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,,,1753-318X,,,WILEY,,,ISI000519290900001,82,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, WATER RESOURCES",1,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",AALIPOURCRIMSON.UA.EDU,,KT8VX,,"ALIPOUR, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ALABAMA, DEPT CIVIL CONSTRUCT \& ENVIRONM ENGN, CTR COMPLEX HYDROSYST RES, TUSCALOOSA, AL 35487 USA",ISI,UNIV ALABAMA,UNIV ALABAMA,,"ALIPOUR A, NA, J FLOOD RISK MANAG","ALIPOUR A, NA, J FLOOD RISK MANAG",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0,6,1_13,0,2

Climate patterns around the world were affected causing marked anomalies and important socioeconomic impacts in different countries. During this period, colombia experienced a hydroclimatic anomaly expressed in precipitation levels above normal and extreme events such as flash floods, landslides, and long-term flooding of plains in different regions of the country. Losses and damages to infrastructure, crops, and livelihoods reached more than 7.8 billion us dollars (approximately 2\% of 2011 gdp). Due to the flooding of a vast area, about 2,350,000 people were affected, and as consequence most of them were expelled from their territories to live in alien territories in very difficult conditions, in these areas, many social conflicts either arose or worsened. Some of these conflicts are pointed out at the end of this chapter with the aim that they may serve as lessons for strengthening the regional disaster risk management for being better prepared against adverse impacts of similar extreme events in the future.",LA NINA 2010-2011; FLOODS IN COLOMBIA,CLIMATE VARIABILITY; SOUTH-AMERICA,ENGLISH,"ARTICLE, BOOK CHAPTER",INCOLLECTION,1,"ARIAS PA, 2015, CLIM DYNAM, V45, P2861, DOI 10.1007/S00382-015-2511-7.;BOM AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF METEOROLOGY, 2012, REC BREAK NIN EV AN.;CAMPOS A, 2012, ANAL GESTION RIESGO, P411.;CEPAL, 2012, VAL DAN PERD INV COL.;DIAZ H, 2000, NINO SO OSCILLATION, P497.;EUSCATEGUI C, 2011, ANAL IMPACTO FENOMEN, P32.;GLANTZ MH, 1997, CURRENTS OF CHANGE, P194.;GUIZA L, 2012, REV LETRAS VERDES, V12, P24.;HERNANDEZ-PENA YT, 2013, THESIS U NACL COLOMB.;HOYOS N, 2013, APPL GEOGR, V39, P16, DOI 10.1016/J.APGEOG.2012.11.018.;IDEAM, 2011, AN IMP FEN LA NIN 20, P2010.;IDEAM, 1998, POS EF NAT SOC EC FE.;IDEAM-DPAD, 2002, EF NAT SOC FEN EL NI.;IGAC-IDEAM-DANE, 2011, REP FIN AR AF IN 201.;KENYON J, 2010, J CLIMATE, V23, P6248, DOI 10.1175/2010JCLI3617.1.;LI WH, 2011, J PLANT ECOL, V4, P91, DOI 10.1093/JPE/RTQ039.;MASON SJ, 2001, B AM METEOROL SOC, V82, P619, DOI 10.1175/1520-0477(2001)082<0619:PPAAWE>2.3.CO,2.;PABON JD, 2008, EARTH SCI RES J, V12, P194.;PABON JD, 2011, NATURAL DISASTERS PO, P127.;POVEDA G., 2004, REV ACAD COLOMB CIEN, V38, P201.;RASMUSSON EM, 1983, SCIENCE, V222, P1195, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.222.4629.1195.;RASMUSSON EM, 1982, MON WEATHER REV, V110, P354, DOI 10.1175/1520-0493(1982)110<0354:VITSST>2.0.CO,2.;RENDON-ACEVEDO, 2012, 2011 ANO INTERESANTE.;RIPPEY BR, 2015, WEATHER CLIM EXTREME, V10, P57, DOI 10.1016/J.WACE.2015.10.004.;ROPELEWSKI CF, 1987, MON WEATHER REV, V115, P1606, DOI 10.1175/1520-0493(1987)115<1606:GARSPP>2.0.CO,2.;STOCKDALE TN, 2010, PROCEDIA ENVIRON SCI, V1, P55, DOI 10.1016/J.PROENV.2010.09.006.;TORRES-PINEDA CE, 2012, THESIS U NACL COLOMB.;TORRES-PINEDA CE, 2017, VARIABILIDAD INTRAES.;VARGAS G, 2016, LECCIONES AM LATINA, P63.;YEPES J, 2013, REV COLOMB AMAZONICA, V6, P17.","VARGAS, G (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV NACL COLOMBIA, DEPT GEOG, CARRERA 30 45-03,EDIFICIO 212,OFICINA 327, BOGOTA, DC, COLOMBIA.;VARGAS, GERMAN, DANIEL PABON, JOSE, UNIV NACL COLOMBIA, DEPT GEOG, CARRERA 30 45-03,EDIFICIO 212,OFICINA 327, BOGOTA, DC, COLOMBIA.;HERNANDEZ, YOLANDA, UNIV DIST FRANCISCO JOSE DE CALDAS, FAC ENVIRONM, BOGOTA, COLOMBIA.",10.1007/978-3-319-56469-2\_15,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","MAL, S AND SINGH, RB AND HUGGEL, C",,"978-3-319-56469-2, 978-3-319-56468-5",2523-3084,,217-232,SPRINGER INTERNATIONAL PUBLISHING AG,,2018,ISI000449692800017,30,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES",0,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES",GVARGASCUNAL.EDU.CO YTHERNANDEZPUDISTRITAL.EDU.CO JDPABONCUNAL.EDU.CO,SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS SERIES,BL3HI,"CLIMATE CHANGE, EXTREME EVENTS AND DISASTER RISK REDUCTION: TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS","VARGAS, G (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV NACL COLOMBIA, DEPT GEOG, CARRERA 30 45-03,EDIFICIO 212,OFICINA 327, BOGOTA, DC, COLOMBIA",ISI,UNIV NACL COLOMBIA;UNIV DIST FRANCISCO JOSE DE CALDAS,UNIV NACL COLOMBIA,,"VARGAS G, 2018, CLIMATE CHANGE, EXTREME EVENTS AND DISASTER RISK REDUCTION: TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS","VARGAS G, 2018, CLIMATE CHANGE, EXTREME EVENTS AND DISASTER RISK REDUCTION: TOWARDS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS",TRUE,0,2,0,0,0,2_6_7,1_13,0,5

343,Majewski W,"Measures and solutions for flood management. A local case: flash flood 2001 in gdansk, poland",IRRIGATION AND DRAINAGE,"The population of the globe is constantly growing. At the same time the number of people living in cities is exploding. Today, in many countries the population of the cities amounts to 80\% of the total country's population. Floods in urban areas occur more and more frequently, they cause considerable economic and social losses mainly because of developed and expensive city infrastructure. Today, infrastructure goes underground, which is very flood prone in case of inundation. In urban areas measures and solutions for flood mitigation primarily have an engineering character. However, it is quite often difficult to find advantageous technical solutions, because existing city infrastructure restricts the introduction of appropriate new constructions. Another important factor in urban areas is the considerable propagation speed of floods, which requires advanced, good planning of solutions in the case of a (potential) inundation. The flash flood in gdansk in 2001 can be considered as an example of an interesting local case with lessons for other cities with medieval downtown areas. Gdansk, the historic polish city, is situated at the mouth of the vistula river (1047 km long), and is the most flood-prone agglomeration in poland. Here, floods can come from three directions. The first is down from the moraine hills during severe precipitation, the second direction is from the gulf of gdansk during storm surges, the third is from the main vistula channel when very high discharges come down the river. This paper presents a description of (severe) floods in the gdansk area over the past centuries. They were caused mainly by ice jams, which were formed along the final section of the vistula river, which has a rather complicated layout. In july 2001 a severe flash flood, coming down from the moraine hills, invaded gdansk causing considerable economic and social losses. A long and intensive rainfall caused it. One of the crucial objects during this flood was the artificial radunia channel, constructed in the 14th century. The main aim of this channel was the supply of fresh water to the city of gdansk. In this paper an analysis of this flood is presented.. Detailed measurements of all watercourses in the gdansk area, together with hydrological and hydraulic studies, have been carried out. A 1d unsteady flow model of the gdansk water node was developed. Calculations were carried out to find the best technical solutions to mitigate consequences of a similar flood in the future. It was proposed to construct 18 small retention reservoirs in the catchment of radunia channel, 4 additional control discharge structures from radunia channel and in addition 2 flood retention polders.

325,Van Der Ploeg Rr;Gieska M;Schweigert P,Impact of postwar agricultural soil management on surface hydrology and river peak discharge,BERICHTE UBER LANDWIRTSCHAFT,"The frequency of extreme stages and floods along rivers like rhine and danube seems to have increased after the second world war. The question, as to whether this increased frequency is due to climate changes or human impacts, has been raised repeatedly. We hypothesize that the increased frequency is related to the intensification of german agriculture. For the pre-sent study, we analyzed developments in german agronomy after world war ii, especially in soil tillage. We also analyzed flood stages of the river rhine at cologne, both for prewar and postwar times. The analysis revealed that the relation between peak discharge of a flood wave on one side, and catchment rainfall on the other, has changed after the war. Our calculations show, for example, that an extreme rainfall amount of 200 mm in the rhine catchment within one month results in a mean peak discharge at cologne that presently is 1544 m(3) s(-1) higher than before the war. Simultaneously, our analysis indicates that conventional soil tillage after world war ii was intensified. During heavy or long lasting rainstorms, this intensified conventional tillage seems to promote surface runoff. We assume that postwar intensified tillage has led to a physical soil degradation that at least partly explains the increased frequency of extreme stages and floods along germany's rivers. To reduce the threat of flash floods, it seems recommendable to extend conservation tillage subsidies.",,GERMANY; LAND,GERMAN,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,6,"[ANONYMOUS], 1972, SCS NAT ENG HDB 4.;BARDOSSY A, 1990, THEOR APPL CLIMATOL, V42, P155, DOI 10.1007/BF00866871.;BERRYHILL WS, 1989, PESTICIDES IN TERRESTRIAL AND AQUATIC ENVIRONMENTS, P397.;BOELS D, 1982, ICW PUBLICATION, V12.;BORK H.

120,Petrucci O;Pasqua Aa;Polemio M,Flash flood occurrences since the 17th century in steep drainage basins in southern italy,ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT,"The historical floods that have occurred since the seventeenth century were collected for a study area in southern italy. Damages caused by floods, rainfall and the main anthropogenic modifications are discussed all together. The aim was to assess whether the frequency of floods is changing and, if so, whether these changes can be attributed to either rainfall and/or anthropogenic modifications. In 4 \% of cases, mainly occurred in past centuries, floods damaged people. Hydraulic works, roads and private buildings were the more frequently damaged elements (25, 18 and 14 \% of the cases, respectively). The annual variability of rainfall was discussed using an annual index. Short duration-high intensity rainfalls were characterized considering time series of annual maxima of 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h and daily rainfall. The rainfall shows a decreasing trend, in terms of both the annual maximum of short duration and the annual amount. The population has been progressively increasing since the sixteenth century, except during the years following the catastrophic 1908 earthquake. The rate of population growth has been very high since the second half of the twentieth century, the urbanized areas greatly increased, especially following the second half of the twentieth century. At the same time, the trend of damaging floods has been increasing, especially since the seventies. The analysis indicates that, despite a rainfall trend favourable towards a reduction in flood occurrence, floods damage has not decreased. This seems to be mainly the effect of mismanagement of land use modifications.",FLOODS; HISTORICAL RESEARCH; RAINFALL TREND; LAND USE; ANTHROPOGENIC MODIFICATIONS; POPULATION NUMBER; URBAN PLANNING; CALABRIA; ITALY,CATALONIA NE SPAIN; DOCUMENTARY SOURCES; RISK; EVENTS; FREQUENCY; CLIMATE; RECONSTRUCTION; CENTURIES; CALABRIA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,9,"AFAN DE RIVERA C, 1832, CONSIDERAZIONI MEZZI, V1.;AGASSE E, 2003, PAL HIST FLOODS CLIM, P99.;BALASCH JC, 2010, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V10, P2317, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-10-2317-2010.;BARRERA A., 2005, ADV GEOSCI, V2, P111.;BARTL S, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P1805, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-1805-2009.;BENITO G, 2004, NAT HAZARDS, V31, P623.;BOHM O, 2006, HYDROLOG SCI J, V51, P79.;BRAZDIL R, 2006, HYDROLOG SCI J, V51, P739, DOI 10.1623/HYSJ.51.5.739.;BRUNETTI M., 2011, MODIFICAZIONI CLIMAT, P57.;BULLON T, 2011, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V11, P2215, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-11-2215-2011.;CINGARI G, 1988, STORIA CITTA ITALIAN.;COEUR D, 2008, CR GEOSCI, V340, P644, DOI 10.1016/J.CRTE.2008.03.001.;COPIEN C, 2008, NAT HAZARDS, V45, P173, DOI 10.1007/S11069-007-9166-6.;CURRO G., 1991, REGGIO CALABRIA.;DE KRAKER AMJ, 2006, HYDROLOG SCI J, V51, P913, DOI 10.1623/HYSJ.51.5.913.;DE LORENZO AM, 1870, ZAGARA, V26, P396.;DE NAVA P, 1894, TORRENTI PRIMA CALAB.;GALANTI GM, 1792, GIORNALE VIAGGIO CAL.;GAMBI L, 1978, REGIONI ITALIA CALAB.;GIUSTINIANI L, 1797, DIZIONARIO GEOGRAFIC, V1.;GLASER R, 2003, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V3, P1.;GLASER R, 2010, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V101, P235, DOI 10.1007/S10584-010-9816-7.;GRIMALDI A., 1863, CASSA SACRA OVVERO S.;IBBEKEN H, 1991, SOURCE SEDIMENT CASE.;IPPOLITO F, 1955, CONDIZIONI GEOLOGICH.;KENDALL MG, 1975, RANK CORRELATION MET.;LASTORIA B., 2006, ADV GEOSCI, V7, P223, DOI DOI 10.5194/ADGE0-7-223-2006.;LLASAT MC, 2005, J HYDROL, V313, P32, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2005.02.004.;MANN HB, 1945, ECONOMETRICA, V13, P245, DOI 10.2307/1907187.;MARZOLLA B, 1851, PROVINCIA CALABRIA C.;MUDELSEE M, 2004, J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS, V109, DOI 10.1029/2004JD005034.;NAULET R, 2005, J HYDROL, V313, P58, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2005.02.011.;NAULET R, 2001, ADV NAT TECHNOL HAZ, V17, P113.;OGNIBEN L, 1973, GEOL ROMANA, V12, P243.;PECORA A, 1963, TUTTITALIA ENCICLOPE, P77.;PETRUCCI O, 2007, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V7, P361, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-7-361-2007.;PETRUCCI O, 2003, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V3, P17, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-3-17-2003.;PETRUCCI O, 2009, ENVIRON MANAGE, V43, P483, DOI 10.1007/S00267-008-9234-Z.;PETRUCCI O, 2007, QUADERNO OSSERVATORI.;PETRUCCI O, 2005, QUADERNO OSSERVATORI.;PETRUCCI O, 2009, QUADERNO OSSERVATORI.;PIRRELLO S, 1954, REALTA NUOVA, VXIX, P669.;POLEMIO M, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P129, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-129-2012.;POLEMIO M, 2010, Q J ENG GEOL HYDROGE, V43, P403, DOI 10.1144/1470-9236/09-006.;POLEMIO M, 2008, GEOL SOC SPEC PUBL, V288, P39, DOI 10.1144/SP288.4.;POLEMIO M, 1998, P INT C PREV CAT IDR, P63.;POLEMIO M, 1998, ENG GEOLOGY ENV, P1849.;POLEMIO M, 2010, Z GEOMORPHOL, V54, P195, DOI 10.1127/0372-8854/2010/0054S2-0011.;ROHR C, 2006, HYDROLOG SCI J, V51, P834, DOI 10.1623/HYSJ.51.5.834.;SEIDEL J, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P175, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-175-2009.;SEN PK, 1968, J AM STAT ASSOC, V63, P1379, DOI DOI 10.1080/01621459.1968.10480934.;SPANO BOLANI D, 1857, STORIA REGGIO CALABR.;TORTORICI L, 1982, RENDICONTI SOC ITALI, V38, P940.;VALLVE MB, 1998, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V38, P473, DOI 10.1023/A:1005343828552.;VIPARELLI M, 1972, U NAPOLI PUBBL, V276.;VIPARELLI M, 1959, 6 CONV IDR COSTR IDR.;WAHLIN K, 2010, ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS, V165, P217, DOI 10.1007/S10661-009-0940-7.;ZAPPIA C, 1718, MEMORIE SERVIRE ST 2, P[438, 109].;ZAPPIA C, 1718, MEMORIE SERVIRE ST 1, V1, P[438, 66].","POLEMIO, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), CNR IRPI, VIA AMENDOLA 122-1, I-70126 BARI, ITALY.;POLEMIO, MAURIZIO, CNR IRPI, I-70126 BARI, ITALY.;PETRUCCI, OLGA, PASQUA, A.

This event caused 35 fatalities and severe damage to property as rainfall totals locally exceeded 550 mm in 24 h and 620 mm in 48 h. The main issue of the present study is to discuss how realistically the spatial and temporal rainfall distribution of this flash flood event can be represented with present state-of-the-art operational and research modeling frameworks, the predictability of the present event for different forecast ranges is investigated and sensitivity studies are conducted in order to discuss the influence of model physics (convection, microphysics), atmospheric moisture: analysis and mediterranean sea surface temperature forcing on the quality of the results. It is shown that the present event could be reasonably predicted on forecast ranges of 2-3 days as it was essentially determined by strong moisture advection from the mediterranean coupled with frontal and orographical lifting. However, precipitation scores show significant sensitivity to both analysis errors and model physics. (C) 2001 elsevier science b.v.

The present paper provides information about this event, which was caused by intense precipitation lasting two days. We put this individual event in perspective by examining the climate track in the observation and projection of flood hazard through analyzing changes in temperature, precipitation and intense precipitation. We also examine the non-climatic factors of flood risk, such as spatial development and river regulation. Further, we pose the question of whether actions aimed at flood risk reduction, predominantly by way of structural defenses in the catchment of the kumiela river, really reduce the flood risk in elblag. We also offer more general remarks pertaining to flood risk reduction in poland, primarily based on technical measures, and we unveil the shortcomings of the current flood risk management system in poland. In the social consciousness, the structural flood defense strategy has become the norm of thinking in terms of methods for reducing the effects of floods in poland, but this does not always contribute to reducing flood damage either locally or nationally.

285,Trigo Rm;Ramos C;Pereira Ss;Ramos Am;Zezere Jl;Liberato Mlr,The deadliest storm of the 20th century striking portugal: flood impacts and atmospheric circulation,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The deadliest storm affecting portugal since, at least, the early 19th century, took place on the 25 and 26 november 1967 causing more than 500 fatalities. This work aims to assess the most relevant aspects of this episode. This includes describing the associated meteorological conditions and key hydrological characterisation such as the level of exceptionality of the observed precipitation at different temporal scales, or the estimation of peak discharge values in 20 small river catchments affected. Additionally, from a human impact perspective we provide a full account of all the main socio-economic impacts, particularly the numbers and location of victims (dead, injured, homeless and evacuated). Based on the sub-daily time series of a representative station, and its intensity-duration-frequency curves, we have found that the exceptionality of this rainfall event is particularly linked to rainfall intensities ranging in duration from 4 to 9 h compatible with return periods of 100-years or more. This range of time scale which are similar to the estimated concentration time values of the hydrographic basins affected by the flash flood event. From a meteorological perspective, this episode was characterised by strong convection at the regional scale, fuelled by high availability of moisture over the lisbon region associated with a low pressure system centered near lisbon that favoured the convective instability. Most victims were sleeping or were caught by surprise at home in the small river catchments around the main lisbon metropolitan area. The majority of people who died or who were severely affected by the flood lived in degraded housing conditions often raised in a clandestine way, occupying flood plains near the stream beds. This level of destruction observed at the time is in stark contrast to what was observed in subsequent episodes of similar amplitude.

A layer of mud (2 to 3 metres thick) covered the streets of la rabita (the village most damaged). The roads and the bridges of comunication between the town and the rest of the province were destroyed along with 250 hectares of cultivated land. The damages were estimated at 300 millions of pesetas. A heavy rainstorm (600 mm) produced the rapid development of a high density flow in the dry stream, with an elevated volume of sediments (113 of the discharge), that was the responsible factor of the high discharge reachedduring the flood (2580 m(3)/s). The object of this study is not only the identification of the episode and the analysis of the disaster's social impact, but also to analyse the different techniques to study the flooding in this type of fluvial system. The historic reconstruction of the event includes an analysis of the social impact and restoration works of the affected area. In addition the hydrologic analyses of the flooding that was based on the study of the greatest floods in small basins has been carried out. Finally, a morphodynamic and sedimentologic reconstruction was undertaken. The sedimentological study of deposits corresponding to the flash flood shows that the dynamic nature of these alluvial channels has important implications for floodplain management policy. The potencial for dramatic changes in geomorphic and hydrologic characteristics of alluvial channels must be considered in establishing procedures for flood hazard evaluation.",,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,"CAPEL-MOLINA J.J., 1974, CUADERNOS GEOGRAFICO, V4, P149.;*COM TECN MIXT, 1974, PLAN COORD OBR REP D.","CORDON, ER (REPRINT AUTHOR), SUBDELEGAC GOBIENO \& GRANADA, GRAN VIA 50, GRANADA 18071, SPAIN.;SUBDELEGAC GOBIENO \& GRANADA, GRANADA 18071, SPAIN.",,"SERRANO 115 DPDO, 28006 MADRID, SPAIN","THORNDYCRAFT, VR AND BENITO, G AND BARRIENDOS, M AND LLASAT, MC",,84-921958-2-7,,,327-332,"CONSEJO SUPERIOR INVESTIGACIONES CIENT, CISC",,2002,ISI000189002600050,4,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, GEOLOGY, HISTORY",3,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, HISTORY",,,BY35D,"PALAEOFLOODS, HISTORICAL DATA AND CLIMATIC VARIABILITY: APPLICATIONS IN FLOOD RISK ASSESSMENT","CORDON, ER (REPRINT AUTHOR), SUBDELEGAC GOBIENO \& GRANADA, GRAN VIA 50, GRANADA 18071, SPAIN",ISI,,NOTREPORTED,,"CORDON ER, 2002, PALAEOFLOODS, HISTORICAL DATA AND CLIMATIC VARIABILITY: APPLICATIONS IN FLOOD RISK ASSESSMENT","CORDON ER, 2002, PALAEOFLOODS, HISTORICAL DATA AND CLIMATIC VARIABILITY: APPLICATIONS IN FLOOD RISK ASSESSMENT",TRUE,0,0,0,0,0,1_2_6,1_16,0,2

The effects of the rainfall were a few thousand mass movements, erosion and loss of topsoil, flash floods, and extensive flooding. Damage in three-out of the four states accounted for 384 deaths, 66 missing, 212 municipalities with damages, 39 rivers that burst their banks, around 198,000 people were affected, and 48,000 houses affected to a varying degree. In addition, there was a lot of damage to roads and bridges, and serious wreckage to agriculture (data provided by the governments of puebla, veracruz, and hidalgo). Economic losses were massive. In the state of puebla alone, it is estimated that over 200 million dollars (u.s. \$) will be needed for restoring damaged infrastructure (government report, jan. 15, 2000). This document shows the most relevant aspects of this disaster that took place in the first week of october 1999. It begins by exposing the general features of the area, such as physiography and rainfall patterns, and describes the meteorological phenomenon that caused such widespread damage, by analyzing the rainfall registered during the critical days. The paper continues by stressing the geological characteristics and other causes that contributed to the mass movements in the sierra norte of puebla state.

Regardless of where, when, and how the event has happened, floods affect social security as well as environmental damages. Understanding floods dynamics, their impacts, and management is thus critical, especially in climate risk assessment. In the present study, a flash flood (a case of an episodic hydrological event) which happened on january 11, 2018, in morogoro, tanzania, is examined and synthesized. Data were courtesy of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration global forecasting system (noaa gfs) (forecast data), tanzania meteorological agency (tma), and sokoine university of agriculture (for the automatic weather data). With the help of zygrib-grib file visualization software (version 8.01, under general public license (gnu gpl v3)), the forecast data and patterns of the observation from the automatic weather station (temperatures, wind speed and directions, rainfall, humidity, and pressure) and the long-term rainfall data analysis in the study area made it possible. This study contributes to the knowledge of understanding the changing weather for planning and management purposes. Both forecasts and the observations captured the flash flood event. The rain was in the category of heavy rainfall (more than 50mm per day) as per the regional guidelines. The synergy between the forecasts and the 30-minute weather observation interval captured the fundamental weather patterns that describe the event. For studying the nature and impacts of flash floods in the region, the integration of automatic weather observation into the systems of national meteorological centers is inevitable. Additionally, as part of an integrated disaster risk reduction effort, there is a need for a review on catchment management strategies.",,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,none,"KIMAMBO, ON (REPRINT AUTHOR), SOKOINE UNIV AGR, DEPT GEOG \& ENVIRONM STUDIES, SOLOMON MAHLANGU COLL SCI \& EDUC, MOROGORO, TANZANIA.;KIMAMBO, ON (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV VENDA, SCH ENVIRONM SCI, DEPT ECOL \& RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, THOHOYANDOU, SOUTH AFRICA.;KIMAMBO, OFFORO NEEMA, SOKOINE UNIV AGR, DEPT GEOG \& ENVIRONM STUDIES, SOLOMON MAHLANGU COLL SCI \& EDUC, MOROGORO, TANZANIA.;KIMAMBO, OFFORO NEEMA, UNIV VENDA, SCH ENVIRONM SCI, DEPT ECOL \& RESOURCE MANAGEMENT, THOHOYANDOU, SOUTH AFRICA.;CHIKOORE, HECTOR, UNIV VENDA, SCH ENVIRONM SCI, DEPT GEOG \& GEOINFORMAT SCI, THOHOYANDOU, SOUTH AFRICA.;GUMBO, JABULANI RAY, UNIV VENDA, SCH ENVIRONM SCI, DEPT HYDROL \& WATER RESOURCES, THOHOYANDOU, SOUTH AFRICA.",10.1155/2019/8505903,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",,"UNIVERSITY OF VENDA, LIMPOPO, SOUTH AFRICA",,1687-9309,,,HINDAWI LTD,2019,2019,ISI000467050500001,39,METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES,1,METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES,OFFOROGMAIL.COM HECTOR.CHIKOOREUNIVEN.AC.ZA JABULANI\_GUMBOYAHOO.CO.UK,,HW9ZZ,,"KIMAMBO, ON (REPRINT AUTHOR), SOKOINE UNIV AGR, DEPT GEOG \& ENVIRONM STUDIES, SOLOMON MAHLANGU COLL SCI \& EDUC, MOROGORO, TANZANIA",ISI,SOKOINE UNIV AGR;UNIV VENDA;UNIV VENDA;UNIV VENDA,SOKOINE UNIV AGR,,"KIMAMBO ON, 2019, ADV METEOROL","KIMAMBO ON, 2019, ADV METEOROL",TRUE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1_16,0,2

Italy, due to climate, morphology and anthropization, is particularly subject to these phenomena. The major consequences of the flash floods occur in small basins, characterized by modest times of concentration and low storage capacity, especially if located close to urban areas. From this point of view, the development of alert systems can mitigate the impact of the phenomenon on the population. The paper will analyze the problems related to flash flood through two case studies near reggio calabria.

The geohydrological event had important ground effects, among them the simultaneous flooding of entella and rupinaro streams, in chiavari city. In lower lavagna valley, the main tributary of the entella, a landslide caused two casualties, while serious damage to buildings and infrastructures were registered in chiavari's old town and in the nearby communities of carasco and cogorno. In the entella basin, the rainfall peaked at 60 mm/hour and accumulated 220 mm in six hours. The levels of the streams rose instantly, showing concentration times of less than an hour. The entella rose seven meters, flooding carasco, cogorno, and the caperana neighborhood of chiavari. Flash flooding of the rupinaro stream caused water to rise to 1.5 m in chiavari's historic core. Analyses were carried out of the weather conditions and the ground effects of the events, in addition, studies were made of the main causes of the geo-hydrological risk. In particular, variations in climate and uncontrolled urban development were the cause of increased geo-hydrological hazards and vulnerability of this area, historically subject to flooding.

This has caused considerable losses, especially for people living in the area. The flood occurred due to high rainfall intensity and inadequate land covering, especially in the upstream area (north bandung region) where the area is filled with housing, villas, and open land. Consequently, the water catchment area decreases. The objective of this study is to identify flood discharge that occurs due to high rainfall intensity and land covering. Flood discharge is calculated using a rational method. Based on bmkg data, rain intensity on march 20, 2018, is 45 mm/hour. The results of this study show that with this intensity, the cipamokolan river flow brings water with sediment and debris waste. The discharge of the river is 207 m3/s. It equals to 2.2 times river basin discharge and causing water to overflow into the land around the river.

445,Majewski W,Measures and solutions for flood management local case - flash flood in gdansk 2001,"FLOODS, FROM DEFENCE TO MANAGEMENT, SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS","The number of people inhabiting our globe is constantly increasing. At the same time the amount of people living in the cities is growing very fast. This way in many countries the population of the cities amounts to 80\% of the total country's population. Floods in urban areas are more and more frequent. These floods cause considerable economic and social losses mainly because of developed and expensive city infrastructure. This infrastructure goes now very often underground, which is very flood prone in case of inundation of the city. In urban areas measures and solutions for flood mitigation are primarily of engineering character. However, very often it is difficult to find advantageous technical solutions, because existing city infrastructure restricts the introduction of appropriate new constructions. Another important factor in urban areas is considerable speed of floods, which requires earlier, good planning of solutions in case of inundation. Flash flood in gdansk in 2001 can be considered as an example of local case. Gdansk the polish old city situated at the mouth of the vistula river (1047 kin long) is most flood prone agglomeration in poland. There are three possible flood directions. First is from the moraine hills, in case of intensive precipitation, second direction is from the gulf of gdansk in case of storm surges and the third is from the main vistula channel in case of very high discharge. The paper presents the description of floods in the area of gdansk during past centuries. They were caused mainly by ice jams which formed along final section of vistula river of very complicated layout. In july 2001 a severe flash flood, coming from the moraine hills invaded gdansk causing considerable economic and social losses. It was caused by very high and intensive rainfall. One of the main objects in this flood was an artificial radunia channel, constructed in the xi v century. The main aim of this channel was the supply of water to the city of gdansk. In the paper the analysis of this flood is presented. Detailed measurements of all water courses, hydrological and hydraulic analysis were carried out. I d unsteady flow model of the gdansk water node was developed. Calculations were carried out to find the best technical solutions to mitigate consequences of a similar flood in the future. It was proposed to construct 18 small retention reservoirs in the catchment of radunia channel, 4 additional control discharge structures from radunia channel and in addition 2 flood polders. The network of measuring stations was also proposed.",,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,"JASINSKA E., 2004, P DEFR FLOOD COAST M.;JASINSKA E., 2002, HYDROLOGY HYDRODYNAM.;MAJEWSKI W, 2002, P C INT DIS RISK MAN.;MAJEWSKI W, 2004, MODEL WATER DISTRIBU.","MAJEWSKI, W (REPRINT AUTHOR), POLISH ACAD SCI, INST HYDRO ENGN, GDANSK, POLAND.;POLISH ACAD SCI, INST HYDRO ENGN, GDANSK, POLAND.",,"11 NEW FETTER LANE, LONDON EC4P 4EE, ENGLAND","VANALPHEN, J AND VANBEEK, E AND TAAL, M",,0-415-39120-2,,,205-215,TAYLOR \& FRANCIS LTD,,2006,ISI000236403200022,4,"ENGINEERING, WATER RESOURCES",0,"ENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL, ENGINEERING, CIVIL, WATER RESOURCES",,,BEA21,"FLOODS, FROM DEFENCE TO MANAGEMENT, SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS","MAJEWSKI, W (REPRINT AUTHOR), POLISH ACAD SCI, INST HYDRO ENGN, GDANSK, POLAND",ISI,INST HYDRO ENGN,INST HYDRO ENGN,,"MAJEWSKI W, 2006, FLOODS, FROM DEFENCE TO MANAGEMENT, SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS","MAJEWSKI W, 2006, FLOODS, FROM DEFENCE TO MANAGEMENT, SYMPOSIUM PROCEEDINGS",TRUE,1,6,0,0,0,2_6,1_16,0,2
370,Halounova L;Holubec V,Assessment of flood with regards to land cover changes,"4TH INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON BUILDING RESILIENCE, INCORPORATING THE 3RD ANNUAL CONFERENCE OF THE ANDROID DISASTER RESILIENCE NETWORK","Floods seem to be more and more a serious problem in the czech republic. Geographical occurrence of floods has become less predictable recently, since flash floods have the main role at the beginning of flood events. Flash flood has a bigger impact to our environment than ordinary floods, as municipalities are prepared in most cases for the ordinary ones. Land cover type is an important factor due to its influence on the precipitation water runoff for a decision what kind of crop is suitable for a given region. This choice can substantially affect the future impact of floods (e.g. Corn is a crop which can negatively influence the area during the flash floods). The second problem is an expansion of crop to forest areas ( deforestation). This process has also a negative impact on influence of upcoming flash flood. The paper deals with assessment of land cover type with regard to its possible impacts on flash flood impacts when the main danger does not come from the river but from hillsides around urban areas and assessment of flood with regards to land cover changes. In this paper, the available remote sensing data will be analyzed for this task as well as the analysis of available technology which can be used in areas where the data from remote sensing cannot be used in the required time frame or quality - for example which kind of data from field surveying will be needed or if there is an opportunity for using uav. The paper will serve as a basic source for future analyses where individual issues will be analyzed. (C) 2014 the authors.

528,Khan Ta;Alam M;Kadir K;Shahid Z;Mazliham Ms,A comparison review based on classifiers and regression models for the investigation of flash floods,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS,"Several regions of the world have been affected by one of the natural disasters named as flash floods. Many villagers who live near stream or dam, they suffer a lot in terms of property, cattle and human lives loss. Conventional early warning systems are not up to the mark for the early warning announcements. Diversified approaches have been carried out for the identification of flash floods with less false alarm rate. Forecasting approaches includes some errors and ambiguity due to the incompetent processing algorithms and measurement readings. Process variables like stream flow, water level, water color, precipitation velocity, wind speed, wave's pattern and cloud to ground (cg) flashes have been measured for the robust identification of flash floods. A vibrant competent algorithm would be required for the investigation of flash floods with less false alarm rate. In this research paper classifiers have been applied on the collected data set so that any researcher could easily know that which classifier is competent and can be further enhanced by combining it with other algorithms. A novel comprehensive parametric comparison has been performed to investigate the classification accuracy for the robust classification of false alarms. For the better accuracy more than one process variables have been measured but still contained some false alarm. Appropriate combination of sensor was integrated to increase the accuracy in results as multi-modal sensing device has been designed to collect the data. Linear discriminant analysis, logistic regression, quadratic support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor and ensemble bagged tree have been applied to the collected data set for the data classification. Results have been obtained in the matlab and discussed in detail in the research paper. The worst accuracy of the classification (62\%) has been achieved by the coarse k-nn classifier that means coarse k-nn produced 38\% false negative rate that is not acceptable in the case of forecasting. Ensemble bagged trees produced best classification results as it achieved 99 \% accuracy and 1\% error rate. Furthermore, according to the comprehensive parametric comparison of regression models quadratic svm found to be the worst with mean square error of 0.5551 and time elapsed 13.159 seconds. On the other hand, exponential gaussian process regression performed better than the other existing approaches with the minimum root mean squared error of 0.0002 and prediction speed of 35000 observations per second.",FLASH FLOODS; CLASSIFICATION; SVM; K-NN; LOGISTIC REGRESSION; QUADRATIC SVN; ENSEMBLE BAGGED TREES; EXPONENTIAL GPR,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"KHAN, TA (REPRINT AUTHOR), USMAN INST TECHNOL, KARACHI, PAKISTAN.;KHAN, TA (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV KUALA LUMPUR, BRITISH MALAYSIAN INST, KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA.;KHAN, TALHA AHMED, USMAN INST TECHNOL, KARACHI, PAKISTAN.;KHAN, TALHA AHMED, KADIR, KUSHSAIRY, UNIV KUALA LUMPUR, BRITISH MALAYSIAN INST, KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA.;ALAM, MUHAMMAD, SHAHID, ZEESHAN, INST BUSINESS MANAGEMENT, KARACHI, PAKISTAN.;ALAM, MUHAMMAD, MAZLIHAM, M.

124,Cian F;Marconcini M;Ceccato P,Normalized difference flood index for rapid flood mapping: taking advantage of eo big data,REMOTE SENSING OF ENVIRONMENT,"Climate change projections foresee an increasing number of intense precipitation events with consequent flash and riverine floods. An accurate and rapid mapping of these phenomena is a key component of effective emergency management and disaster risk reduction plans. Earth observation big data such as the ones acquired by the copernicus programme, are providing unprecedented opportunities to detect changes and assess economic impacts in case of disasters. This paper presents an innovative flood mapping technique based on an index which is computed using multi temporal statistics of synthetic aperture radar images. The index compares a large amount of reference scenes to those acquired during the investigated flood and allows an easy categorization of ``flooded areas, either areas solely temporarily covered by water or areas with mixed water and vegetation. The method has been developed specifically to exploit sentinel-1 data but can be applied to any other sensor. It has been tested for the 2010 flood of veneto (italy) and the floods of 2015 in malawi and uganda. Extensive qualitative analysis and cross-comparison with other state-of-the art methods, proved the proposed approach highly reliable and particularly effective, allowing a precise, simple and fast flood mapping.

489,Kim Hi;Keum Hj;Han Ky,Real-time urban inundation prediction combining hydraulic and probabilistic methods,WATER,"Damage caused by flash floods is increasing due to urbanization and climate change, thus it is important to recognize floods in advance. The current physical hydraulic runoff model has been used to predict inundation in urban areas. Even though the physical calculation process is astute and elaborate, it has several shortcomings in regard to real-time flood prediction. The physical model requires various data, such as rainfall, hydrological parameters, and one-/two-dimensional (1d/2d) urban flood simulations. In addition, it is difficult to secure lead time because of the considerable simulation time required. This study presents an immediate solution to these problems by combining hydraulic and probabilistic methods. The accumulative overflows from manholes and an inundation map were predicted within the study area. That is, the method for predicting manhole overflows and an inundation map from rainfall in an urban area is proposed based on results from hydraulic simulations and uncertainty analysis. The second verification algorithm of nonlinear auto-regressive with exogenous inputs (svnarx) model is used to learn the relationship between rainfall and overflow, which is calculated from the u.s. Environmental protection agency's storm water management model (swmm). In addition, a self-organizing feature map (sofm) is used to suggest the proper inundation area by clustering inundation maps from a 2d flood simulation model based on manhole overflow from swmm. The results from two artificial neural networks (svnarx and sofm) were estimated in parallel and interpolated to provide prediction in a short period of time. Real-time flood prediction with the hydraulic and probabilistic models suggested in this study improves the accuracy of the predicted flood inundation map and secures lead time. Through the presented method, the goodness of fit of the inundation area reached 80.4\% compared with the verified 2d inundation model.",REAL-TIME FLOOD PREDICTION; DRAINAGE SYSTEM; URBAN INUNDATION MODEL; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK (ANN),NEURAL-NETWORKS; FLOOD; MODEL; SOM,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,none,"KEUM, HJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), KYUNGPOOK NATL UNIV, DISASTER PREVENT RES INST, 80 DAEHAK RO, DAEGU 41566, SOUTH KOREA.;KIM, HYUN IL, HAN, KUN YEUN, KYUNGPOOK NATL UNIV, DEPT CIVIL ENGN, 80 DAEHAK RO, DAEGU 41566, SOUTH KOREA.;KEUM, HO JUN, KYUNGPOOK NATL UNIV, DISASTER PREVENT RES INST, 80 DAEHAK RO, DAEGU 41566, SOUTH KOREA.",10.3390/W11020293,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,KOREA MINISTRY OF ENVIRONMENT (MOE),,2073-4441,2,,MDPI,11,2019,ISI000460899600112,33,WATER RESOURCES,13,WATER RESOURCES,HYUNN228GMAIL.COM HOJUNKEUMNAVER.COM KSHANJKNU.AC.KR,,HO4NM,,"KEUM, HJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), KYUNGPOOK NATL UNIV, DISASTER PREVENT RES INST, 80 DAEHAK RO, DAEGU 41566, SOUTH KOREA",ISI,KYUNGPOOK NATL UNIV;KYUNGPOOK NATL UNIV,KYUNGPOOK NATL UNIV,,"KIM HI, 2019, WATER","KIM HI, 2019, WATER",FALSE,2,6,1,1,0,0,1_2_3_4,1,2

The rainfall runoff process, however, is highly complex, nonlinear, and temporally and spatially varying because of the variability of the terrain and climate attributes. An intelligent traffic system covering the emergency response capacity in response to flooding impacts in low-lying area of urban region is highly desirable to drivers and passengers nowadays. The proposed motes-based sensor network has three major modules, which are water level monitoring module, network video record module, and data processing module. The water level monitoring module sensors water level information and transmits it to a server computer via motes-based wireless network. The network video record module takes and sends video in real-time to the server too. The data processing module linking existing flooding level with noaa nexrad rainfall prediction data enables us to publish online raw data, predict inundation zone, and disseminate video information through different media.

462,Hofmann J;Schuettrumpf H,Holistic approach for a multifunctional heavy rain risk information tool,WASSERWIRTSCHAFT,"The recent severe weather events in may and june 2018 have once again made us realize that heavy rainfall induced flash floods can occur everywhere, anytime and often be very local in various forms and consequences - a heavy rain risk exists basically in every german municipality! However, efficient and standardized hazard and risk maps are missing throughout germany. A uniform and systematic procedure for documentation and risk analysis for heavy rainfall events does not currently exist. Actual warnings are only based on the precipitation or rather on the intensity of the rainfall, whereby the real threat due to flash floods is just as insufficiently considered as the vulnerability of the urban structures. This article presents an approach for a multifunctional heavy rainfall risk information tool which can be used for systematic documentation, the generation of standardized, high spatially resolved hazard and risk maps as well as for a hydrodynamic, risk based early warning system. The operation principle, the possibilities and limits of the holistic information tool are explained by means of an application example of the city of aachen as wells as the heavy rainfall event of 29.05.2018.",,,GERMAN,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"HOFMANN, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN, INST WASSERBAU \& WASSERWIRTSCHAFT, MIES VAN DER ROHE STR 17, D-52074 AACHEN, GERMANY.;HOFMANN, JULIAN, SCHUETTRUMPF, HOLGER, RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN, INST WASSERBAU \& WASSERWIRTSCHAFT, MIES VAN DER ROHE STR 17, D-52074 AACHEN, GERMANY.",10.1007/S35147-019-0024-8,"ABRAHAM-LINCOLN STASSE 46, WIESBADEN, 65189, GERMANY",,,,0043-0978,4,39-45,SPRINGER VIEWEG-SPRINGER FACHMEDIEN WIESBADEN GMBH,109,2019,ISI000463251000006,11,WATER RESOURCES,0,WATER RESOURCES,HOFMANNIWW.RWTH-AACHEN.DE SCHUETTRUMPFIWW.RWTH-AACHEN.DE,,HR6HR,,"HOFMANN, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN, INST WASSERBAU \& WASSERWIRTSCHAFT, MIES VAN DER ROHE STR 17, D-52074 AACHEN, GERMANY",ISI,SCHUETTRUMPF,INST WASSERBAU AND WASSERWIRTSCHAFT,,"HOFMANN J, 2019, WASSERWIRTSCHAFT","HOFMANN J, 2019, WASSERWIRTSCHAFT",TRUE,1,0,1,2,0,0,1_3,1,2

In the model used to build flash-floods risk maps, the parameters of the basin are analyzed and evaluated and the weight is determined using thomas saaty's analytic hierarchy process (ahp). The flash-floods early-warning software is built using open source programming tools. With the spatial module and online processing, a predicted precipitation of one to six days in advance for imetos (agrimediavietnam) automatic meteorological stations is interpolated and then processed with the potential risk maps (imetos is a weather-environment monitoring system comprising a wide range of equipment and an online platform and can be used in various fields such as agriculture, tourism and services). The results determine the locations of flash floods at several risk levels corresponding to the predicted rainfall values at the meteorological stations. The system was constructed and applied to flash floods disaster early warning for thuan chau in son la province when the rainfall exceeded the 150 mm/d threshold.

32,Meraj G;Romshoo Sa;Yousuf Ar;Altaf S;Altaf F,Assessing the influence of watershed characteristics on the flood vulnerability of jhelum basin in kashmir himalaya,NATURAL HAZARDS,"In himalayan region, it is very important to generate detailed terrain information for identifying the causes of natural hazards such as debris flows, debris floods, and flash floods, so that appropriate corrective measures are initiated for reducing the risk of the people and property to these disasters. Basic watershed morphometrics coupled with the land-cover and slope information are useful for assessing the hazard vulnerability. The terrain characteristics govern the surface hydrology and have profound influence on the incidence and magnitude of natural hazards, particularly floods. The present work is a comparative study of two watersheds of jhelum basin (upper indus basin in kashmir). In this research, we make an integrated use of the linear imaging self-scanner satellite data and advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer digital elevation model, supported with extensive field information, in a gis environment for assessing the surface hydrological behavior of lidder and rembiara watersheds of the jhelum basin. Knowledge-driven modelling approach has been used to evaluate the runoff potential of the watersheds to assess the flood vulnerability downstream. The results revealed that lidder watershed exhibits lesser basin lag time compared to rembiara watershed for a storm event. Further, due to higher population density in the lidder downstream, this watershed is also socially more vulnerable to flooding than rembiara. The methodology and results of this study shall help in formulating better flood mitigation strategies in this part of the himalayan region, where the observation network of hydrometeorological and other land surface parameters is either missing or very scanty.",KASHMIR HIMALAYA; JHELUM BASIN; HYDROLOGY; MORPHOMETRY; RUNOFF POTENTIAL; FLOOD VULNERABILITY,CLIMATE-CHANGE; LAND DEGRADATION; NATURAL HAZARDS; PRIORITIZATION; MORPHOMETRY; IMPACTS; MODEL; SCALE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,34,"ADINARAYANA J, 2003, 1 INT C RES WAT ICRW, P405.;AGARWAL A, 1996, FLOODS FLOODPLAINS E.;ALTAF F., 2013, GEOGRAPHY J, V2013.;ALTAF S, 2014, ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS, DOI [10.1007/S10661014-4012-2, DOI 10.1007/S10661014-4012-2].;ARNELL N, 2002, HYDROLOGY GLOBAL ENV.;BADAR B, 2013, ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS, V185, P6419, DOI 10.1007/S10661-012-3035-9.;BADAR B, 2013, J EARTH SYST SCI, V122, P433, DOI 10.1007/S12040-013-0285-Z.;BARREDO JOSE I, 2010, SUSTAINABILITY, V2, P1327, DOI 10.3390/SU2051327.;BARRY R.G., 1998, ATMOSPHERE WEATHER C.;BATES PD, 2000, J HYDROL, V236, P54, DOI 10.1016/S0022-1694(00)00278-X.;BERZ G, 2001, NAT HAZARDS, V23, P443, DOI 10.1023/A:1011193724026.;BHAT SALIM AIJAZ, 2013, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, V3, P1625, DOI 10.6088/IJES.2013030500032.;BHAT S.A., 2009, J APPL HYDROLOGY, VXXI, P23.;BHAT S.A., 2014, J ECOSYST, V2014, DOI [DOI 10.1155/2014/898054, 10.1155/2014/898054].;BOSCH JM, 1982, J HYDROL, V55, P3, DOI 10.1016/0022-1694(82)90117-2.;BRASINGTON J, 1998, COMPUT GEOSCI, V24, P299, DOI 10.1016/S0098-3004(97)00081-2.;CARLSTON C.W., 1963, 422C US GEOL SURV.;CHAKRABORTI A.K., 1991, P 12 AS C REM SENS S.;CHAPONNIERE A, 2008, HYDROL PROCESS, V22, P1908, DOI 10.1002/HYP.6775.;CHEN LG, 2011, WATER RESOUR MANAG, V25, P3445, DOI 10.1007/S11269-011-9864-4.;CHOW V.

95,Coles D;Yu D;Wilby Rl;Green D;Herring Z,"Beyond `flood hotspots': modelling emergency service accessibility during flooding in york, uk",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"This paper describes the development of a method that couples flood modelling with network analysis to evaluate the accessibility of city districts by emergency responders during flood events. We integrate numerical modelling of flood inundation with geographical analysis of service areas for the ambulance service and the fire \& rescue service. The method was demonstrated for two flood events in the city of york, uk to assess the vulnerability of care homes and sheltered accommodation. We determine the feasibility of emergency services gaining access within the statutory 8- and 10-min targets for high priority, life-threatening incidents 75\% of the time, during flood episodes. A hydrodynamic flood inundation model (floodmap) simulates the 2014 pluvial and 2015 fluvial flood events. Predicted floods (with depth >25 cm and areas >100m(2)) were overlain on the road network to identify sites with potentially restricted access. Accessibility of the city to emergency responders during flooding was quantified and mapped using, (i) spatial coverage from individual emergency nodes within the legislated timeframes, and, (ii) response times from individual emergency service nodes to vulnerable care homes and sheltered accommodation under flood and non-flood conditions. Results show that, during the 2015 fluvial flood, the area covered by two of the three fire \& rescue service stations reduced by 14\% and 39\% respectively, while the remaining station needed to increase its coverage by 39\%. This amounts to an overall reduction of 6\% and 20\% for modelled and observed floods respectively. During the 2014 surface water flood, 7 out of 22 care homes (32\%) and 15 out of 43 sheltered accommodation nodes (35\%) had modelled response times above the 8-min threshold from any ambulance station. Overall, modelled surface water flooding has a larger spatial footprint than fluvial flood events. Hence, accessibility of emergency services may be impacted differently depending on flood mechanism. Moreover, we expect emergency services to face greater challenges under a changing climate with a growing, more vulnerable population.

Patterns from recent years suggest the intensity of flooding are increasing and may continue more aggressively during the coming years because of increased magnitude of the monsoon rains and identified climatic changes in the region. Mapping of flood hazard is essential for planning and mitigation purpose. However, only flood hazard mapping is not sufficient to assess the magnitude of risk to lives and property. Risk mapping is an integral part of pre and post disaster management. Furthermore, the earth observation (eo) data could be helpful to update flood risk maps time to time by covering many aspects e.g. Population concentration areas, critical infrastructure and commercial areas, to enhance the preparedness planning and mitigation measure against risk of flood. Pakistan has experienced the devastating flood in 2010 due to unexpected heavy rainfall in the monsoon season with enormous losses to property lives and infrastructure in several districts. The union council agra, district charsadda was among the affected most districts by riverine and flash floods. Additionally, growing population in flood plains is another threat to the district. However, to cope with this situation there is immense need to detect risk index to prevent further damages caused by such floods. This study aims to prepare the hazard, vulnerability and risk index for river kabul and swat catchment area of union council agra, charsadda. The flood risk was identified, and risk index maps were prepared by executing a methodology for assessing risk, based on the physical exposure of the flood hazard, vulnerability of people, and the exposure of critical assets to flood water. Explicitly, spatial flood risk index maps were produced with the help of analytical spatial modeling by considering the areas exposed to flood hazard, morphological characteristics and socio-economic indicators. The produced flood risk maps were verified through visual examination through 3d city flood maps. Results illustrate that the areas of higher flood risk overlapped with the areas of high flood hazard along with high population density and socio-economic exposure to vulnerability.",HAZARD; VULNERABILITY; RISK; GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION SYSTEM (GIS); REMOTE SENSING (RS); DISASTER RISK REDUCTION (DRR); PARTICIPATORY RURAL APPRAISAL (PRA) TOOLS; WEIGHTED OVERLAY,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,"ADEOYE NO, 2009, ADV NAT APPL SCI, V3, P369.;AHMAD H., 2011, PAK ENG C 71 ANN SES.;ALCANTARA-AYALA I., 2015, DISASTER RISKS RES A.;HAQ UL.

Floods are a severe threat to the angkor world heritage site. Studies of regional floods and flood hazard zoning have played an increasingly important role in ensuring sustainability of the angkor site. This study developed a flood hazard index (fhi) model based on a geographic information system (gis) and used synthetic aperture radar (sar) data to extract historical floods at angkor from 2007 to 2013. Four indices (flood affected frequency, absolute elevation, elevation standard deviation, drainage density) were used to identify flood-prone areas. The analytic hierarchy process (ahp) and the delphi method were employed to determine the weight of each index. The weighted indices were then used to develop a distribution map of flood hazards at angkor. The results show that 9 monuments are at risk by potential floods among the 52 components of the angkor monuments. The high hazard and moderate-to-high hazard areas in the core zone are mainly located surrounding the west baray but will not bring direct risk impact on the monuments located in the core archaeological zone. The moderate hazard areas are located on both sides of the siem reap and roluos rivers and in the flooded area of the tonle sap lake in the core archaeological zone. These areas cover 19.4 km(2), accounting for 9.13\% of the total area of the core zone. This moderate hazard zone poses a greater flood threat to the core zone and must be given higher attention. The buffer zone is a small area with fewer sites. As such, flooding has a low impact on the buffer zone. The methods used in this study can be applied to flood hazard assessments of other heritage sites in southeast asia.",ANGKOR SITE; SAR; FLOOD HAZARD ASSESSMENT; ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS,CULTURAL-HERITAGE; RISK-ASSESSMENT; EARTH OBSERVATION; WATER MANAGEMENT; FLASH-FLOOD; TONLE SAP; CITY; REGION; GIS; IMPACTS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,4,none,"XU, ZW (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHINESE ACAD SCI, INST REMOTE SENSING \& DIGITAL EARTH, 9 DENGZHUANG SOUTH RD, BEIJING 100094, PEOPLES R CHINA.;XU, ZW (REPRINT AUTHOR), JIANGXI UNIV SCI \& TECHNOL, SCH ARCHITECTURAL \& SURVEYING ENGN, 86 HONGQI AVE, GANZHOU 341000, PEOPLES R CHINA.;LIU, JIE, XU, ZHIWEI, CHEN, FULONG, CHEN, FANG, ZHANG, LU, CHINESE ACAD SCI, INST REMOTE SENSING \& DIGITAL EARTH, 9 DENGZHUANG SOUTH RD, BEIJING 100094, PEOPLES R CHINA.;LIU, JIE, UNIV CHINESE ACAD SCI, BEIJING 100049, PEOPLES R CHINA.;XU, ZHIWEI, JIANGXI UNIV SCI \& TECHNOL, SCH ARCHITECTURAL \& SURVEYING ENGN, 86 HONGQI AVE, GANZHOU 341000, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.3390/RS11010098,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,STRATEGIC PRIORITY RESEARCH PROGRAM OF THE CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCESCHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES [XDA19030502],,,1,,MDPI,11,2019,ISI000457935600098,52,REMOTE SENSING,5,REMOTE SENSING,LIUJIERADI.AC.CN XZW13217072705163.COM CHENFLRADI.AC.CN CHENFANGRADI.AC.CN LUZHANGCEODE.AC.CN,,HK4NP,,"XU, ZW (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHINESE ACAD SCI, INST REMOTE SENSING \& DIGITAL EARTH, 9 DENGZHUANG SOUTH RD, BEIJING 100094, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,INST REMOTE SENSING AND DIGITAL EARTH;UNIV CHINESE ACAD SCI;JIANGXI UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,INST REMOTE SENSING AND DIGITAL EARTH,,"LIU J, 2019, REMOTE SENS","LIU J, 2019, REMOTE SENS",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0,7,1_3,0,1

Accordingly, the present work is addressed to the assessment of the flood risk depending on spatial analytic hierarchy process of the integration between both remote sensing techniques (rst) and geographic information systems (gis). This integration results in enhancing the analysis with the savings of time and efforts. There are several remote sensing-based data used in conducting this research, including a digital elevation model with an accuracy of 30m, spatial soil and geologic maps, historical daily rainfall records, and data on rainwater drainage systems. Five return periods (reps) (2, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100, and 200years) corresponding to flood hazards and vulnerability developments maps were applied via the weighted overlay technique. Although the results indicate lower rates of annual rainfall (53-71mm from the southeast to the northwest), the city has been exposed to destructive flash floods. The flood risk categories for a 100-year rep were very high, high, medium, low, and very low with 17\%, 41\%, 33\%, 8\%, and 1\% of total area, respectively. These classes correspond to residential zones and principal roads, which lead to catastrophic flash floods. These floods have caused socioeconomic losses, soil erosion, infrastructure damage, land degradation, vegetation loss, and submergence of cities, as well life loss. The results prove the gis and rst effectiveness in mitigating flood risks and in helping decision makers in flood risk mitigation and rainwater harvesting.",FLOOD HAZARD; FLOOD VULNERABILITY; FLOOD RISK; GIS; RST; AHP,CURVE NUMBER; MORPHOMETRIC-ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLASH FLOODS; RIVER-BASIN; LAND-USE; SCS-CN; SYSTEM; VULNERABILITY; RAINFALL,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,5,none,"RADWAN, F (REPRINT AUTHOR), KING SAUD UNIV, ALAMOUDI WATER RES CHAIR, RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA.;RADWAN, FARID, ALAZBA, A.

Our study area, that forms a part of the governorate of sohag, lies in southeast sohag and is one of the most flash flood prone regions of egypt's eastern desert. In the last decades, this area of sohag has suffered from frequent flash floods, with some flood events resulting in human casualties. In our study, we use a multi-criteria process combined with geographical information system (gis) and remotely sensed data to produce a flash flood susceptibility map. In addition, we discuss the various factors related to flash flooding such as elevation, slope, drainage network, lithology, topographic wetness index, as well as land use, and reclassify these based on their contribution and their effect on flood probability. To calculate the weighted factor for each raster, a pairwise matrix was constructed. Results from our multi-criteria analysis for flash flooding indicate that approximately 5\% of the total study area is at a very high risk of flooding, 10\% at a high risk, and 25\% at a moderate flood risk. Furthermore, our results highlight the areas at risk of flooding and the need for the development of relevant warning systems. Our results also indicate that the southeastern part of the study area is most susceptible to flash floods and we suggest that the necessary focus be given to this region as well as the implementation of a flood warning system.

However, the low precipitation and high evaporation of surface water are a result of the low absorptive capacity of the soil, and, accordingly, higher than normal precipitation often results in run-offs, which have the potential to become flash floods. In a peripheral area of ulaanbaatar, the capital municipality of mongolia, residential areas called ger areas have expanded rapidly in an unplanned manner because of the poor execution of land reform policy, and considerable migration has resulted from a natural hazarddzud. These areas have been encroaching on flash-flood-prone areas, which have resulted in a dozen people losing their lives in 2009. This chapter introduces the background of ger areas expansion and reveals the actual situation of their spatial distribution over fl ash-flood-prone areas using vhr satellite imageries.",ULAANBAATAR; URBAN SPRAWL; VHR SATELLITE IMAGERIES; FLASH FLOOD,CLIMATE-CHANGE; LIVESTOCK; HAZARDS; COMMUNITIES,ENGLISH,"ARTICLE, BOOK CHAPTER",INCOLLECTION,0,"ADRIANTO L., 2002, ENV IMPACT ASSES, V22, P393, DOI DOI 10.1016/S0195-9255(02)00012-4.;AHSAN DA, 2014, INT J DISAST RISK RE, V9, P48, DOI 10.1016/J.IJDRR.2014.02.005.;BEGZSUREN S, 2004, J ARID ENVIRON, V59, P785, DOI 10.1016/J.JARIDENV.2004.02.001.;CHUNG S, 2014, J GEOCHEM EXPLOR, V147, P237, DOI 10.1016/J.GEXPLO.2014.07.016.;FERNANDEZ-GIMENEZ ME, 2015, WORLD DEV, V68, P48, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2014.11.015.;FOODY GM, 2004, J HYDROL, V292, P48, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2003.12.045.;HIWASAKI L, 2014, INT J DISAST RISK RE, V10, P15, DOI 10.1016/J.IJDRR.2014.07.007.;HUANG Y-K, 2013, ENVIRON RES, V124, P1.;JICA, 2009, STUD CIT MAST PLAN 3.;JICA, 2002, SURV REP STUD LIV EN, P294.;JONKMAN SN, 2005, NAT HAZARDS, V34, P151, DOI 10.1007/S11069-004-8891-3.;KAMATA T, 2010, MANAGING URBAN EXPAN.;LIU Q, 2011, J ASIAN EARTH SCI, V40, P926.;MANANDHAR S, 2015, INT J DISAST RISK RE, V11, P47, DOI 10.1016/J.IJDRR.2014.11.002.;MARREN PM, 2005, EARTH-SCI REV, V70, P203, DOI 10.1016/J.EARSCIREV.2004.12.002.;MIDDLETON NJ, 2013, EARTH-SCI REV, V126, P48, DOI 10.1016/J.EARSCIREV.2013.07.008.;MOCELLIN J, 2008, HEALTH PLACE, V14, P228, DOI 10.1016/J.HEALTHPLACE.2007.06.005.;SAIZEN I, 2010, APPL GEOGR, V30, P639, DOI 10.1016/J.APGEOG.2010.01.002.;SINGH-PETERSON L, 2014, INT J DISAST RISK RE, V10, P116, DOI 10.1016/J.IJDRR.2014.07.004.;SNEATH D., 2003, OXFORD DEVELOPMENT STUDIES, V31, P441, DOI 10.1080/1360081032000146627.;SOVACOOL BK, 2011, ENERGY SUSTAIN DEV, V15, P32, DOI 10.1016/J.ESD.2010.10.004.;TACHIIRI K, 2008, J ARID ENVIRON, V72, P2251, DOI 10.1016/J.JARIDENV.2008.06.015.;THE WORLD BANK, 2009, AIR POLL UL IN ASS C.;TOSHIKI K, 2015, J ENVIRON SCI-CHINA, V28, P178, DOI 10.1016/J.JES.2014.08.018.;TSUTSUMIDA N, 2015, HABITAT INT, V47, P196, DOI 10.1016/J.HABITATINT.2015.01.024.;UDDIN SMN, 2014, HABITAT INT, V44, P403, DOI 10.1016/J.HABITATINT.2014.08.006.;UN-HABITAT, 2010, PLANN SUST CIT UN HA, P47.;UN-HABITAT, 2010, ACT PLAN CLOS WORKSH, P74.","SAIZEN, I (REPRINT AUTHOR), KYOTO UNIV, GRAD SCH GLOBAL ENVIRONM STUDIES, KYOTO, JAPAN.;SAIZEN, IZURU, TSUTSUMIDA, NARUMASA, KYOTO UNIV, GRAD SCH GLOBAL ENVIRONM STUDIES, KYOTO, JAPAN.",10.1007/978-4-431-56442-3\_8,"CHIYODA FIRST BLDG E, 3-8-1 NISHI-KANDA CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 101-0065, JAPAN","BANBA, M AND SHAW, R",,"978-4-431-56442-3, 978-4-431-56440-9",2196-4106,,137-148,SPRINGER JAPAN,,2017,ISI000412296500009,28,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY",0,"ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, GEOGRAPHY, PHYSICAL",SAIZENKAIS.KYOTO-U.AC.JP,DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,BI5EE,LAND USE MANAGEMENT IN DISASTER RISK REDUCTION: PRACTICE AND CASES FROM A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE,"SAIZEN, I (REPRINT AUTHOR), KYOTO UNIV, GRAD SCH GLOBAL ENVIRONM STUDIES, KYOTO, JAPAN",ISI,KYOTO UNIV,KYOTO UNIV,,"SAIZEN I, 2017, LAND USE MANAGEMENT IN DISASTER RISK REDUCTION: PRACTICE AND CASES FROM A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE","SAIZEN I, 2017, LAND USE MANAGEMENT IN DISASTER RISK REDUCTION: PRACTICE AND CASES FROM A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE",FALSE,0,3,0,0,0,0,1_3,1,2
170,Piketh Sj;Vogel C;Dunsmore S;Culwick C;Engelbrecht F;Akoon I,Climate change and urban development in southern africa: the case of ekurhuleni municipality (emm) in south africa,WATER SA,"In this paper, outcomes from an investigation of plausible climate futures over the next century, and the potential impacts on water services including water resource management and disaster risk reduction, such as flash flooding in ekurhuleni (emm), are presented. Four key aspects are examined: (i) the extent to which the frequency of extreme rainfall events may change in south africa as a result of climate change, (ii) the identification of some of the implications of extreme rainfall events for local government (iii) the identification of some of the challenges communities most at risk of flooding as a result of extreme rainfall events face, finally, (iv) the opportunities for future co-production of design methods and approaches to reduce current and future climate risks in emm and elsewhere. Climate modelling conducted for this research indicates that it is plausible for an increase in the number of extreme rainfall events to occur over central and eastern south africa over the next century. Over emm, for example, an increase in extreme rainfall events is likely to be accompanied by flash flooding and a range of deleterious impacts, if planning and maintenance of the water services infrastructure is not improved - a result that is likely to be valid for all large metropolitan municipalities in the country. The paper provides some lessons learnt when trying to include a climate risk reduction approach into the planning of urban development.",FLASH FLOODING; URBAN RISK ENVIRONMENTS; CLIMATE CHANGE AND CLIMATE VARIABILITY,PROJECTIONS; ADAPTATION; GOVERNANCE; RAINFALL; DURBAN; LEVEL,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,"AKOON I, 2010, THESIS U WITWATERSRA.;BARTLETT S, 2009, CONTR WORLD BANK 5 U.;BATES B.

129,Yang Wt;Wang M;Kerle N;Van Westen Cj;Liu Ly;Shi Pj,Analysis of changes in post-seismic landslide distribution and its effect on building reconstruction,NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Six years after the devastating m-s 8.0 wenchuan earthquake, new landslides, debris flows, and flash floods still occur frequently in the earthquake-stricken regions. This shows that the geological hazards that occur after a major earthquake in a mountainous environment can be a long-term threat. However, post-earthquake reconstruction and relocation of local residents often neglect this evolving threat, and its interaction with existing and rebuilt houses has not been well studied. Here we show that the evolving mountain environment, including the changed geographic distribution of new landslides and the continuously uplifting riverbed, creates emerging risks for existing and rebuilt houses. We use spatial analysis of landslide debris and the location of houses from high-resolution images and field survey in the study area and find that new landslides and the houses rebuilt after the wenchuan earthquake have a similar trend of moving to lower elevations, gentler slopes, and closer to rivers. This study confirms that the persistent downward movement of landslide debris has rapidly filled up riverbeds over the past 6 years. The elevated riverbeds make the study area extremely susceptible to flash floods, creating further risks to newly rebuilt houses that are closer to the river. We highlight the often neglected dynamic process that involves changes in the natural environment and man-made constructions and their interaction. This dynamic process requires long-term monitoring and adaptive management of mountainous regions after major earthquakes that can fully consider the so-phisticated evolving risks caused by the changing environment, exposure, and vulnerability in the region.",,EARTHQUAKE-INDUCED LANDSLIDES; 2005 KASHMIR EARTHQUAKE; CHI-CHI-EARTHQUAKE; WENCHUAN EARTHQUAKE; VEGETATION RECOVERY; EVOLUTION; IMPACTS; EROSION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,8,"ATTA-UR-RAHMAN, 2010, PAKISTAN NAT HAZARDS, V57, P413, DOI [10.1007/S11069-010-9621-7, DOI 10.1007/S11069-010-9621-7].;CHEN CY, 2009, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V105, P355, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2008.10.009.;CHENG JD, 2005, J HYDROL, V306, P161, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2004.09.007.;CUI P, 2011, NAT HAZARDS, V56, P19, DOI 10.1007/S11069-009-9392-1.;DADSON SJ, 2003, NATURE, V426, P648, DOI 10.1038/NATURE02150.;DUNFORD M, 2011, APPL GEOGR, V31, P998, DOI 10.1016/J.APGEOG.2011.01.001.;FAN X, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P3031, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-3031-2012.;FAN XM, 2012, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V171, P58, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2012.05.003.;GORUM T, 2011, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V133, P152, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2010.12.030.;[ HUANG RUNQIU], 2011, [, JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY], V19, P145.;JHA AK, 2010, SAFER HOMES, STRONGER COMMUNITIES: A HANDBOOK FOR RECONSTRUCTING AFTER NATURAL DISASTERS, P7.;JOHNSON C, 2007, DISASTERS, V31, P435, DOI 10.1111/J.0361-3666.2007.01018.X.;KEEFER DK, 1994, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V10, P265, DOI 10.1016/0169-555X(94)90021-3.;KHAN SF, 2013, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V197, P45, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2013.04.033.;KHATTAK GA, 2010, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V115, P102, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2009.09.035.;KOI T, 2008, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V101, P692, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2008.03.007.;KOZIN F, 1990, J ENG MECH-ASCE, V116, P1959, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9399(1990)116:9(1959).;LIN CW, 2006, ENG GEOL, V86, P87, DOI 10.1016/J.ENGGEO.2006.02.010.;LIN WT, 2008, NAT HAZARDS, V47, P331, DOI 10.1007/S11069-008-9222-X.;MAO H., 2009, NEW ARCHITECTURE, P104.;QUARANTELLI E.

29,Elkhrachy I,"Flash flood hazard mapping using satellite images and gis tools: a case study of najran city, kingdom of saudi arabia (ksa)",EGYPTIAN JOURNAL OF REMOTE SENSING AND SPACE SCIENCES,"Flash flood in the cities led to high levels of water in the streets and roads, causing many problems such as bridge collapse, building damage and traffic problems. It is impossible to avoid risks of floods or prevent their occurrence, however it is plausible to work on the reduction of their effects and to reduce the losses which they may cause. Flash flood mapping to identify sites in high risk flood zones is one of the powerful tools for this purpose. Mapping flash flood will be beneficial to urban and infrastructure planners, risk managers and disaster response or emergency services during extreme and intense rainfall events. The objective of this paper is to generate flash flood map for najran city, saudi arabia, using satellite images and gis tools. To do so, we use spot and srtm dems data for which accuracy assessment is achieved by using check points, obtained by gps observations. Analytical hierarchical process (ahp) is used to determine relative impact weight of flood causative factors to get a composite flood hazard index (fhi). The causative factors in this study are runoff, soil type, surface slope, surface roughness, drainage density, distance to main channel and land use. All used data are finally integrated in an arcmap to prepare a final flood hazard map for study area. The areas in high risk flood zones are obtained by overlaying the flood hazard index map with the zone boundaries layer. The affected population number and land area are determined and compared.

468,Sadek M;Li X,"Low-cost solution for assessment of urban flash flood impacts using sentinel-2 satellite images and fuzzy analytic hierarchy process: a case study of ras ghareb city, egypt",ADVANCES IN CIVIL ENGINEERING,"Natural hazards are indeed counted as the most critical challenges facing our world, represented in floods, earthquakes, volcanoes, hurricanes, and forest fires. Among these natural hazards, the flash flood is regarded the most frequent. In this work, we utilized two sentinel-2 satellite images, before and after the flash flood, srtm and photos captured by using a helicopter. This paper aims at three prime objectives. Firstly, the flood influence is determined on the city of ras ghareb, egypt, based on analyzing free satellite data (sentinel-2 images). Secondly, fuzzy the analytical hierarchy process (fahp) method and a geographical information system (gis) are integrated for flood risk analysis and evaluation in the flood-prone area. Finally, such a flood vulnerability map is used as an index to assist the decision-makers prepare for probable flooding. Fahp is preferable as it can cater to the uncertainties in data and analysis. As a result, fahp is appropriate to determine the flood-vulnerable area in cities especially due to the matching with the most destroyed areas identified by the change detection between the two sentinel-2 images. Then, the decision-maker can depend on sentinel-2 images to estimate the flood influence through a regional scale or applying the fahp on cities susceptible to flash floods in case of unavailable satellite images to contribute in establishing an early warning system enough to the evacuation of the risky areas.",,INFORMATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,none,"LI, XX (REPRINT AUTHOR), XI AN JIAO TONG UNIV, SCH HUMAN SETTLEMENTS \& CIVIL ENGN, XIAN 710049, SHAANXI, PEOPLES R CHINA.;SADEK, MOHAMMED, LI, XUXIANG, XI AN JIAO TONG UNIV, SCH HUMAN SETTLEMENTS \& CIVIL ENGN, XIAN 710049, SHAANXI, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.1155/2019/2561215,"ADAM HOUSE, 3RD FLR, 1 FITZROY SQ, LONDON, W1T 5HF, ENGLAND",,CHINESE SCHOLARSHIP COUNCIL - MINISTRY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA [2013FY112500],,1687-8086,,,HINDAWI LTD,2019,2019,ISI000473366400001,34,"CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING",3,"CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, CIVIL",HUPO0311HOTMAIL.COM,,IF8TP,,"LI, XX (REPRINT AUTHOR), XI AN JIAO TONG UNIV, SCH HUMAN SETTLEMENTS \& CIVIL ENGN, XIAN 710049, SHAANXI, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,XI AN JIAO TONG UNIV,XI AN JIAO TONG UNIV,,"SADEK M, 2019, ADV CIV ENG","SADEK M, 2019, ADV CIV ENG",FALSE,0,0,2,0,0,0,1_3_11_17,1,1
152,Cevasco A;Pepe G;D'amato Avanzi G;Giannecchini R,"Preliminary analysis of the november 10, 2014 rainstorm and related landslides in the lower lavagna valley (eastern liguria)",ITALIAN JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENT,"On the evening of november 10, 2014, eight rainfall-induced shallow landslides were triggered on a slope in the lower lavagna valley (eastern liguria, italy). Most of the shallow landslides were channelled as flows into steep hollows and reached the toe of the slope, where some sparse houses were built. One of these landslides impacted and destroyed a building located just at a steep channel outlet, causing two fatalities. Damage affected also agricultural terracing as well as some other buildings and a road running at the toe of the slope, which was buried for long tracts by landslide deposits. Since a few days after the landslides occurrence, various activities were carried out, with the aim of better understanding both the triggering and predisposing factors of landslides. These activities included field surveys, rainfall data analysis, topographic/thematic maps, dem and aerial photo analyses, preliminary laboratory tests on soil samples. From the analyses performed, it seems that, in addition to the rainfall characteristics of the november 10, 2014 event, the antecedent rainfall may have played an important role as landslides predisposing factor. Other relevant predisposing factors can be referred to slope steepness, presence of hollows, stratigraphic and structural settings at the source areas and lack of maintenance of terracing. Investigations are still in progress to achieve a complete geotechnical and hydraulic characterization of soils. Furthermore, it is also expected to extend the analyses performed to the whole area affected by shallow landslides. However, we believe the results of this study can be helpful in shallow landslide modelling, hazard assessment and planning of appropriate risk mitigation measures.",EASTERN LIGURIA; DEBRIS FLOW; INTENSE RAINFALL; SHALLOW LANDSLIDE,SHALLOW LANDSLIDES; INTENSE RAINFALL; FLASH-FLOOD; RIVER-BASIN; LAND-USE; EVENT; ENVIRONMENT,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,6,"ARPAL-CFMI-PC, 2013, ATL CLIM LIG.;AVANZI GD, 2015, ENGINEERING GEOLOGY FOR SOCIETY AND TERRITORY, VOL 2: LANDSLIDE PROCESSES, P515, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-09057-3\_85.;BRANDOLINI P, 2018, LAND DEGRAD DEV, V29, P630, DOI 10.1002/LDR.2672.;BRANDOLINI P, 2015, ENGINEERING GEOLOGY FOR SOCIETY AND TERRITORY, VOL 5: URBAN GEOLOGY, SUSTAINABLE PLANNING AND LANDSCAPE EXPLOITATION, P759, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-09048-1\_147.;BRUNETTI MT, 2010, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V10, P447, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-10-447-2010.;CAINE N, 1980, GEOGR ANN A, V62, P23, DOI 10.2307/520449.;CASSOLA F, 2015, ATMOS RES, V164, P210, DOI 10.1016/J.ATMOSRES.2015.05.010.;CEVASCO A, 2008, RENDICONTI ONLINE SO, V3, P212.;CEVASCO A, 2010, ITAL J ENG GEOL ENV, V10, P33, DOI 10.4408/IJEGE.2010-01.O-03.;CEVASCO A, 2015, REND ONLINE SOC GEOL, V35, P66, DOI 10.3301/ROL.2015.65.;CEVASCO A, 2015, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V532, P208, DOI 10.1016/J.SCITOTENV.2015.06.017.;CEVASCO A, 2013, J MAPS, V9, P289, DOI 10.1080/17445647.2013.780188.;CEVASCO A, 2014, B ENG GEOL ENVIRON, V73, P859, DOI 10.1007/S10064-013-0544-X.;D'AMATO AVANZI G, 2013, REND ONLINE SOC GEOL, V24, P76.;DI CRESCENZO G, 2005, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V66, P255, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2004.09.015.;DIODATO N, 2017, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V282, P74, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2017.01.010.;FACCINI F, 2015, REND ONLINE SOC GEOL, V35, P124, DOI 10.3301/ROL.2015.80.;GIANNECCHINI R, 2015, ENGINEERING GEOLOGY FOR SOCIETY AND TERRITORY, VOL 2: LANDSLIDE PROCESSES, P1581, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-09057-3\_281.;GIANNECCHINI R, 2012, PHYS CHEM EARTH, V49, P32, DOI 10.1016/J.PCE.2011.12.005.;HUNGR O, 2014, LANDSLIDES, V11, P167, DOI 10.1007/S10346-013-0436-Y.;GALVE JP, 2016, ENG GEOL, V213, P142, DOI 10.1016/J.ENGGEO.2016.09.002.;PERSICHILLO MG, 2016, LANDSLIDES AND ENGINEERED SLOPES: EXPERIENCE, THEORY AND PRACTICE, VOLS 1-3, P1605.;PERSICHILLO MG, 2017, GEOMAT NAT HAZ RISK, V8, P748, DOI 10.1080/19475705.2016.1265011.;SILVESTRO F, 2016, J HYDROL, V541, P50, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2015.08.004.;SILVESTRO F, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P2743, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-2743-2012.;VARNES D.

Results from the meff v2.0 db,WATER,"Recent events in western attica in greece (24 deaths in november 2017), in the balearic islands (13 deaths in october 2018), and in southern france (15 deaths in october 2018) show that flood-related mortality remains a major concern in mediterranean countries facing flash floods. Over the past several years, many initiatives have arisen to create databases on flood-related mortality. An international initiative started in 2011 pooling regional and national databases on flood mortality from region and/or countries bordering the mediterranean sea. The mediterranean flood fatality database (meff db) brings together, in 2018, six mediterranean regions/countries: catalonia (spain), balearic islands (spain), southern france, calabria (italy), greece, and turkey, and covers the period 1980-2018. Meff db is on progress and, every year, new data are included, but for this study, we kept only the preliminary data that were geolocated and validated on 31st of december 2018. This research introduces a new step in the analysis of flood-related mortality and follows the statistical description of the meff db already published. The goals of this paper are to draw the spatial distribution of flood mortality through a geographical information system (gis) at different spatial scales: country, nuts 3 (nomenclature of territorial units for statistics. Level 3) regions, catchment areas, and grid. A fatality rate (f: number of deaths/year/million of inhabitants) is created to help this analysis. Then, we try to relate mortality to basic (human or physical) drivers such as population density, rainfall seasonality, or rainfall frequency across the mediterranean basin. The mapping of f shows a negative mortality gradient between the western and the eastern parts of the mediterranean sea. The south of france appears to be the most affected region. The maps also highlight the seasonality of flood-related deaths with the same west-east gradient. It confirms that flood mortality follows the climatological seasonal patterns across the mediterranean basin. Flood-related fatalities mainly occur during the early fall season in the western part of the mediterranean area, while the easter basin is affected later, in november or during the winter season. Eastern turkey introduces another pattern, as mortality is more severe in summer. Mortality maps are then compared with factors that potentially contribute to the occurrence of flood fatalities, such as precipitation intensity (rainfall hazard), to explain geographical differences in the fatality rate. The density of a fatal event is correlated to the population density and the rainfall frequency. Conversely, the average number of deaths per event depends on other factors such as prevention or crisis management.",FLASH FLOOD; MORTALITY; VULNERABILITY; FLOOD HAZARD; PREVENTION; MEDITERRANEAN REGION,FLASH-FLOOD; LANDSLIDE RISK; FATALITIES; GREECE; LIFE; RAINFALL; DISASTER; DATABASE; IMPACT; MODEL,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,none,"VINET, F (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV MONTPELLIER 3, UMR GRED GOUVERNANCE RISQUES ENVIRONM DEV, F-34090 MONTPELLIER, FRANCE.;VINET, FREDDY, BIGOT, VICTORIA, BOISSIER, LAURENT, UNIV MONTPELLIER 3, UMR GRED GOUVERNANCE RISQUES ENVIRONM DEV, F-34090 MONTPELLIER, FRANCE.;PETRUCCI, OLGA, ACETO, LUIGI, PASQUA, ANGELA A., CNR, IRPI, RES INST GEOHYDROL PROTECT, I-87036 COSENZA, ITALY.;PAPAGIANNAKI, KATERINA, KOTRONI, VASSILIKI, NATL OBSERV ATHENS, INST ENVIRONM RES \& SUSTAINABLE DEV, ATHENS 15236, GREECE.;CARMEN LLASAT, MARIA, LLASAT-BOTIJA, MONTSERRAT, UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT APPL PHYS, E-08028 BARCELONA, SPAIN.;GRIMALT, MIQUEL, ROSSELLO, JOAN, UNIV ILLES BALEARS, GRP CLIMATOL HIDROL RISCS \& PAISATGE, PALMA DE MALLORCA 07122, SPAIN.;KILIC, OZGENUR, KAHRAMAN, ABDULLAH, SAMSUN UNIV, FAC AERONAUT \& ASTRONAUT, DEPT METEOROL ENGN, TR-55420 SAMSUN, TURKEY.;TRAMBLAY, YVES, UNIV MONTPELLIER, CNRS, IRD, HYDROSCI MONTPELLIER, F-34090 MONTPELLIER, FRANCE.",10.3390/W11102196,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,ANR DEUFIFRENCH NATIONAL RESEARCH AGENCY (ANR); UNIVERSITY OF PAUL VALERY MONTPELLIER 3,,,10,,MDPI,11,2019,ISI000495598400240,83,WATER RESOURCES,1,WATER RESOURCES,FREDDY.VINETUNIV-MONTP3.FR VICTORIABIGOTGMAIL.COM OLGA.PETRUCCIIRPI.CNR.IT KATPAPNOA.GR CARMELLMETEO.UB.EDU KOTRONINOA.GR LAURENTBOISSIERFREE.FR ACETOIRPI.CNR.IT MIQUEL.GRIMALTUIB.ES MLLASATMETEO.UB.EDU PASQUAIRPI.CNR.IT JOAN.ROSSELLOGELIUIB.ES MMOZGENURKILICGMAIL.COM KAHRAMANMETEOGREEN.COM YVES.TRAMBLAYIRD.FR,,JL5VD,,"VINET, F (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV MONTPELLIER 3, UMR GRED GOUVERNANCE RISQUES ENVIRONM DEV, F-34090 MONTPELLIER, FRANCE",ISI,FRANCE.;RES INST GEOHYDROL PROTECT;INST ENVIRONM RES AND SUSTAINABLE DEV;UNIV BARCELONA;UNIV ILLES BALEARS;SAMSUN UNIV;UNIV MONTPELLIER,NOTDECLARED,,"VINET F, 2019, WATER","VINET F, 2019, WATER",TRUE,1,0,1,0,0,1,1_3_13,0,1
258,Mwenelupembe J;Mylius Hg,Geological hazards and anthropogenic impacts on the environment in malawi: lesson from a case study of debris flows in zomba,"EAST AFRICAN GREAT LAKES: LIMNOLOGY, PALAEOLIMNOLOGY AND BIODIVERSITY","Natural geological hazards such as flash floods, landslides, debris flows and mudflows have caused, and will continue to cause, many problems in malawi. Landslide risks are primarily a geological problem and it is quaternary geology that concerns our environment most. It is a typical geological task to reconstruct the old events using geological, geomorphological and dating methods and based on these results, predict possible future disasters. Our studies of old and recent debris flow events in southern malawi have found out that these phenomena are mainly triggered by tropical cyclones that bring heavy rainfalls. They occur in mountain slopes with certain slope instability, soil cover and discontinuity patterns of the underlying rocks. Human impacts on the environment such as large scale earthworks projects and replacement of natural forests by non endemic tree species have also played an important role in a rising risk of flash floods and debris flows, it is recommended that the most sustainable method of mitigation against these hazards is to incorporate the geological hazard zoning maps into town and regional planning schemes. Where this may not be possible, measures that can reduce or minimise the hazard impact should be adopted. Zomba mountain is made of a mesozoic syenite pluton that intruded precambrian high-grade metamorphic gneisses and granulites. Weathering erosion and uplift have left the syenite standing at an elevation of 2000 meters while the surrounding area is between 700 and 1000 meters above sea level. Zomba town is located at the foot of the mountain. Steep slopes with up to 50degrees, the highly jointed syenite, and the thick lateritic soil covers are the main factors likely to influence rock, instability, debris flows triggered by heavy rainfall have affected zomba since memorial times. People of zomba and the authorities are well aware of past landslides and the continued risk. As a result from our investigations the detailed risk zoning of zomba contributes to the disaster preparedness plan of the town.",,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,"BLOOMFIELD K, 1965, GEOLOGICAL SURVEY DE, V16.;CARTER GS, 1971, GEOLOGICAL SURVEY DE, V6.;INGRAM JH, 1946, PROCEDURES INQUEST 2.;JOHNSON TC, 2001, GEOLOGY, V29, P83, DOI 10.1130/0091-7613(2001)029<0083:DROCVS>2.0.CO,2.;*MET DEP, 1973, NAT TROP CYCL WARN P.","MWENELUPEMBE, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), GEOL SURVEY DEPT, POB 27, ZOMBA, MALAWI.;GEOL SURVEY DEPT, ZOMBA, MALAWI.",,"PO BOX 17, 3300 AA DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS","ODADA, EO AND OLAGO, DO",,1-4020-0772-8,,,557-573,SPRINGER,12,2002,ISI000179074600024,7,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, GEOLOGY, MARINE \& FRESHWATER BIOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES",0,"ECOLOGY, GEOLOGY, LIMNOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES",,ADVANCES IN GLOBAL CHANGE RESEARCH,BV47J,"EAST AFRICAN GREAT LAKES: LIMNOLOGY, PALAEOLIMNOLOGY AND BIODIVERSITY","MWENELUPEMBE, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), GEOL SURVEY DEPT, POB 27, ZOMBA, MALAWI",ISI,,NOTREPORTED,,"MWENELUPEMBE J, 2002, EAST AFRICAN GREAT LAKES: LIMNOLOGY, PALAEOLIMNOLOGY AND BIODIVERSITY","MWENELUPEMBE J, 2002, EAST AFRICAN GREAT LAKES: LIMNOLOGY, PALAEOLIMNOLOGY AND BIODIVERSITY",FALSE,1_2,0,1,0,0,0,1_3_13,1,5
35,Faccini F;Luino F;Sacchini A;Turconi L;De Graff Jv,"Geohydrological hazards and urban development in the mediterranean area: an example from genoa (liguria, italy)",NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"The metropolitan area and the city of genoa has become a national and international case study for geohydrological risk, mainly due to the frequency of floods. In 2014, there were landslides again, as well as flash floods that have particularly caused casualties and economic damage. The weather features of the gulf of genoa and the geomorphological-environmental setting of the ligurian coastal land are the predisposing factors that determine heavy rains and their resulting effects on the ground. This study analysed the characteristics of the main meteorological disasters that have hit genoa since the start of the 20th century, changes in the rainfall regime are evaluated and the main stages of urbanization of the area are detailed, with the resulting changes to the drainage network, in order to identify the main causes of this high geohydrological risk. To this end, scientists have used climate data recorded at the station of genoa university, in operation since 1833, and at ponte carrega station, located in the middle reach of the bisagno stream, a well-known watercourse because of its frequent floods. Urban sprawl was evaluated through a multi-temporal mapping comparison, using maps available from the beginning of the 19th century up to the current regional technical maps. The average air temperature in genoa shows a statistically significant increase, while the number of rainy days displays an equally clear decrease over time. The total annual rain value does not seem to indicate rather noticeable changes. The intensity of rain in genoa expressed as rainfall rate, i.e. The ratio of annual rainfall and number of rainy days, shows statistically significant growth. The geohydrological vulnerability in genoa has increased over time due to urban development which has established modifications in land use, from agricultural to urban, especially in the valley floor. Waterways have been confined and reduced to artificial channels, often covered in their final stretch, in some cases they have even been totally removed. These actions should be at least partially reversed in order to reduce the presently high hydrological risk.",,HEAVY RAINFALL; DEBRIS FLOW; DOCUMENTARY SOURCES; RISK-MANAGEMENT; EASTERN LIGURIA; LAND-USE; EVENT; OCTOBER; FLOODS; LANDSLIDE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,29,"AGRILLO G., 2013, ATLANTE CLIMATICO LI.;ALMAGIA R., 1907, STUDI GEOGRAFICI SOP, V3.;ANAGNOSTOPOULOU C., 2006, ADV GEOSCI, V7, P9, DOI DOI 10.5194/ADGEO-7-9-2006.;[ANONYMOUS], 2000, CORRIERE SERA N 1124.;[ANONYMOUS], 2013, REPUBBLICA NEWSPAPER.;[ANONYMOUS], 2013, CORRIERE SERA NEWSPA.;[ANONYMOUS], 2011, URB IT 2011.;[ANONYMOUS], 2000, CORRIERE SERA N 1107.;ARONICA GT, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P1295, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-1295-2012.;BAIONI D, 2011, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V11, P3035, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-11-3035-2011.;BARTHOLY J, 2006, INT J CLIMATOL, V26, P1517, DOI 10.1002/JOC.1392.;BEGERT M, 2005, INT J CLIMATOL, V25, P65, DOI 10.1002/JOC.1118.;BLOSCHL G, 2013, HYDROL EARTH SYST SC, V17, P5197, DOI 10.5194/HESS-17-5197-2013.;BOSSOLASCO M, 1971, GEOFIS METEOROL, V20, P122.;BRANDOLINI P, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P943, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-943-2012.;BRANDOLINI P., 1994, STUDI GEOGRAFICI ONO, P57.;BUDETTA P, 2004, B ENG GEOL ENVIRON, V63, P293, DOI DOI 10.1007/S10064-004-0244-7.;BURBY RJ, 2006, ANN AM ACAD POLIT SS, V604, P171, DOI 10.1177/0002716205284676.;BUZZI A, 2014, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V14, P1325, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-14-1325-2014.;CAREDIO F., 1996, ATT CONV INT ALBA 96, P5.;CATI L., 1971, ANN IDROLOGICI 2, P74.;CEVASCO A, 2010, ITAL J ENG GEOL ENV, V10, P33, DOI 10.4408/IJEGE.2010-01.O-03.;CEVASCO A, 2013, J MAPS, V9, P289, DOI 10.1080/17445647.2013.780188.;CIPOLLA F., 1999, CATALOGO NAZL LOCALI.;CIPOLLA F., 1993, 229 CNR GNDFI.;COLES S., 2001, INTRO STAT MODELING.;COMMITTEE ON INCREASING NATIONAL RESILIENCE TO HAZARDS AND DISASTERS, 2012, DIRENAT IMP, P244.;CONTI M., 1994, ANALISI IDROLOGICA E.;COROMINAS J, 1990, IAHS, V194, P295.;CORTEMIGLIA G.

Risk assessment of the flash flood identify the critically flood-prone areas and provide assistance in improving the resiliency of mitigation plans. In this study, we developed an assessment of flood susceptibility, vulnerability, the impact of socio-economic, and integrated flash flood index based on the historical data of flood events recorded in kuala lumpur. Data of rainfall characteristics, inundated location, and areas are extracted from the reports of flood events from the year 2005-2015. Each event is then segregated according to the place of incidence, providing point-based recurrence of flood at each identified location. Indicators of assessment include frequency and month of occurrence, rainfall characteristics (of intensity, duration, and depth), and land use categories. A total of 137 (point) locations have been identified, where each location is colour-coded based on a 5-point rating scale. The point-based flood-prone locations are validated with the watershed based of 50-ari rainfall modelling, providing comprehensive hotspot maps.

We first classified the time series landsat imagery acquired at a 2-year interval between 2000 and 2006 using the unsupervised classification method. We then analyzed the extent of major floods through the image matrix analysis on seasonal land cover map pairs. Additionally, we estimated flood volumes and discharge rates for each time series. We finally analyzed the extent of land uses that were affected by major flood events. Accuracy assessment showed that the extent of major floods was accurately mapped. Analysis of trends of major floods revealed that there was a considerable variation in the extent through 2006, with the flood decreasing since 2002. Analysis of flood risk areas based on the 2000-2004 data showed that about 3.04\% of the study areas was at high risk of being flooded. Between 2000 and 2006, about 5.5\% of the study area that are classified as agriculture and built-up land uses was affected by major floods. Our estimates on flood volumes and discharge rates are consistent with the data from other studies. Overall findings suggest that accurate mapping of major floods and flood risk areas using space and time dependent data can be important for developing protocols for flash flood early warning and flood risk management and mitigation. Output gis maps and data combined with crude assumptions about water flow will serve as the baseline data to estimate the amount of water that flows in and out of the basin. Further research should focus on integration of social science research to evaluate the socio-economic impacts of major floods and identifying coping strategies of affected communities.",MAJOR FLOODS; FLOOD RISK MAPPING; LANDSAT; UNSUPERVISED CLASSIFICATION; SONGKHRAM RIVER BASIN; THAILAND,IMAGERY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,4,"ADPC, 2004, VULN ASS CLIM CHANG.;ALSDORF D, 2010, REMOTE SENS ENVIRON, V114, P2448, DOI 10.1016/J.RSE.2010.05.020.;BARBIER EB, 1993, EC VALUATION WETLAND.;BLAKE D., 2006, SITUATION ANAL LOWER.;BLAKE DJH, 2006, RAPID INVENTORY ASSE.;C SRETTHACHAU, 2005, TAI BAAN RES ECOLOGY.;CHAVEZ PS, 1994, PHOTOGRAMM ENG REM S, V60, P571.;CHUTIRATANAPHAN S, 2001, 22 AS C REM SENS 5 9.;CONGALTON R G, 1999, ASSESSING ACCURACY R.;COULTER LL, 2008, SENSORS-BASEL, V8, P2161, DOI 10.3390/S8042161.;FINLAYSON CM, 1999, WETLANDS INT PUBLICA, V53.;FRIEND R., 2007, SECURING SUSTAINABLE.;KHON KAEN UNIVERSITY, 1997, ENV IMP ASS MIT PLAN.;KHUMSRI M, 2006, MRC C SERIES.;MRC, 2008, 21 MRC.;MRC, 2010, MEK RIV COMM SECR PR.;MRCS/WUP-FIN, 2006, IMP ASS REP WUP FIN.;MRCS/WUP-FIN, 2005, 5 MRCSWUPFIN FINN EN.;NAGABHATLA N, 2007, E P 28 AS C REM SENS.;SAKAMOTO T, 2007, REMOTE SENS ENVIRON, V109, P295, DOI 10.1016/J.RSE.2007.01.011.;SATRAWAHA R, 2009, LIMNOLOGY, V10, P7, DOI 10.1007/S10201-008-0254-4.;STARR P, 2005, CATCH CULTURE, V11.;SUNTORNRATANA U, 2002, MRC C SERIES, V2, P270.;SUWANWERAKAMTORN R, 2007, J REMOTE SENS GIS AS, V8, P36.;TOU J T, 1974, PATTERN RECOGNITION.;ZHOU CH, 2000, PHOTOGRAMM ENG REM S, V66, P633.","THIHA (REPRINT AUTHOR), MAHASARAKHAM UNIV, WALAI RUKHAVEJ BOT RES INST, MAHA SARAKHAM 44150, THAILAND.;THIHA, SATRAWAHA, ROJCHAI, WONGPAKAM, KOMGRIT, MAHASARAKHAM UNIV, WALAI RUKHAVEJ BOT RES INST, MAHA SARAKHAM 44150, THAILAND.",10.1007/S10201-011-0352-6,"1-11-11 KUDAN-KITA, CHIYODA-KU, TOKYO, 102-0073, JAPAN",,"MAHASARAKHAM UNIVERSITY, THAILAND",,1439-8621,1,163-170,SPRINGER TOKYO,13,2012,ISI000301482900018,26,MARINE \& FRESHWATER BIOLOGY,19,LIMNOLOGY,THIHAMSU.AC.TH,,908IA,,"THIHA (REPRINT AUTHOR), MAHASARAKHAM UNIV, WALAI RUKHAVEJ BOT RES INST, MAHA SARAKHAM 44150, THAILAND",ISI,MAHASARAKHAM UNIV,MAHASARAKHAM UNIV,,"THIHA T, 2012, LIMNOLOGY","THIHA T, 2012, LIMNOLOGY",FALSE,2,3,0,0,0,0,1_3_13_17,1_2,1
102,Rawat Pk;Pant Cc;Tiwari Pc;Pant Pd;Sharma Ak,Spatial variability assessment of river-line floods and flash floods in himalaya a case study using gis,DISASTER PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT,"Purpose - the main objective of the study is to identify the vulnerable areas for river-line and flash flood hazard and its mitigation through gis database management system (dbms) of geo-hydrometeorological parameters. The dabka watershed constitutes a part of the kosi basin in the lesser himalaya, india in district nainital has been selected for the case illustration. Design/methodology/approach - the dabka dbms is constituted of three gis (geographic information system) modules, i.e. Geo-informatics (consists of geomorphology, soils, geology and land use pattern, slope analysis, drainage density and drainage frequency), weather informatics (consists of daily, monthly and annual weather data about temperature, rainfall, humidity and evaporation) and hydro-informatics (consist of runoff, sediment delivery, and denudation). The geo-informatics and weather informatics modules carried out by comprehensive field work and gis mapping than both modules used to carry out hydro-informatics module. Through the integration and superimposing of spatial data and attribute data with their gis layers of all these modules prepared flood hazard index (fhi) to identify the level of vulnerability for flood hazards and their socio-economic and environmental risks. Findings - the results suggest that geo-environmentally most stressed areas of barren land (i.e. Riverbeds, flood plain, denudational hills, sites of debris flow, gullies, landslide prone areas etc.) Have extreme vulnerability for flood hazard due to high rate of runoff, sediment load delivery and denudation during rainy season (i.e. Respectively 84.56 l/s/km(2), 78.60 t/km(2) and 1.21 mm/year) whereas in geo-environmentally least stressed dense forest areas (i.e. Oak, pine and mixed forests) have low vulnerability due to low rate of stream runoff, sediment load delivery and denudation (i.e. Respectively 20.67 l/s/km(2), 19.50 t/km(2) and 0.20 mm/year). The other frazzled geo-environment which also found high vulnerable for flood hazard and their risks is agricultural land areas due to high rate of stream runoff, sediment load delivery and denudation rates (i.e. Respectively 53.15 l/s/km(2), 90.00 t/km(2) and 0.92 mm/year). Research limitations/implications - for hydro-informatics module it is quite difficult to monitor water and sediment discharge data from each and every stream of the himalayan terrain due the steep and rugged topography. It requires strategic planning and trained man power as well as sufficient funds, therefore representative micro-watershed approach of varied ecosystem followed for a three years (2006-2008) period. Practical implications - the study will have great scientific relevance in the field of river-line flood and flash flood hazard and its socio-economic and environmental risks prevention and management in himalaya and other mountainous terrain of the world. Originality/value - this study generated primary data on hydro-informatics and weather informatics to integrate with geo-informatics data for flood hazard assessment and mitigation as constitutes a part of multidisciplinary project, department of science and technology (d.s.t.)

568,Ritter J;Berenguer M;Corral C;Park S;Sempere-Torres D,Reaffirm: real-time assessment of flash flood impacts - a regional high-resolution method,ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL,"Flash floods evolve rapidly in time, which poses particular challenges to emergency managers. One way to support decision-making is to complement models that estimate the flash flood hazard (e.g. Discharge or return period) with tools that directly translate the hazard into the expected socio-economic impacts. This paper presents a method named reaffirm that uses gridded rainfall estimates to assess in real time the flash flood hazard and translate it into the corresponding impacts. In contrast to other studies that mainly focus on individual river catchments, the approach allows for monitoring entire regions at high resolution. The method consists of the following three components: (i) an already existing hazard module that processes the rainfall into values of exceeded return period in the drainage network, (ii) a flood map module that employs the flood maps created within the eu floods directive to convert the return periods into the expected flooded areas and flood depths, and (iii) an impact assessment module that combines the flood depths with several layers of socioeconomic exposure and vulnerability. Impacts are estimated in three quantitative categories: population in the flooded area, economic losses, and affected critical infrastructures. The performance of reaffirm is shown by applying it in the region of catalonia (ne spain) for three significant flash flood events. The results show that the method is capable of identifying areas where the flash floods caused the highest impacts, while some locations affected by less significant impacts were missed. In the locations where the flood extent corresponded to flood observations, the assessments of the population in the flooded area and affected critical infrastructures seemed to perform reasonably well, whereas the economic losses were systematically overestimated. The effects of different sources of uncertainty have been discussed: from the estimation of the hazard to its translation into impacts, which highly depends on the quality of the employed datasets, and in particular on the quality of the rainfall inputs and the comprehensiveness of the flood maps.",FLASH FLOOD; FLOOD IMPACT MODELING; REAL-TIME IMPACT ASSESSMENT; EARLY WARNING SYSTEM; UNCERTAINTY; FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT,EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS; RADAR RAINFALL; PRECIPITATION; UNCERTAINTY; PREDICTION; FORECASTS; RISK; VALIDATION; HYDROLOGY; GUIDANCE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"RITTER, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV POLITECN CATALUNA, CTR APPL RES HYDROMETEOROL, BARCELONATECH, JORDI GIRONA 1-3 C4, ES-08034 BARCELONA, SPAIN.;RITTER, JOSIAS, BERENGUER, MARC, CORRAL, CARLES, PARK, SHINJU, SEMPERE-TORRES, DANIEL, UNIV POLITECN CATALUNA, CTR APPL RES HYDROMETEOROL, BARCELONATECH, JORDI GIRONA 1-3 C4, ES-08034 BARCELONA, SPAIN.",10.1016/J.ENVINT.2019.105375,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",,H2020 PROJECT ANYWHERE [H2020-DRS-1-2015-700099],,0160-4120,,,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,136,2020,ISI000512533700006,70,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,1,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES,RITTERCRAHI.UPC.EDU,,KK1UC,,"RITTER, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV POLITECN CATALUNA, CTR APPL RES HYDROMETEOROL, BARCELONATECH, JORDI GIRONA 1-3 C4, ES-08034 BARCELONA, SPAIN",ISI,UNIV POLITECN CATALUNA,UNIV POLITECN CATALUNA,,"RITTER J, 2020, ENVIRON INT","RITTER J, 2020, ENVIRON INT",FALSE,1,0,2,0,0,2_6,1_3_16,0,2
392,Westerberg Lo;Hagberg E,"Geomorphology and pedology of the engaruka archaeological environment, tanzania, and the effects of the 1997-1998 el nino flash-flood",CATENA,"Here we analyse geomorphic, pedologic and hydrologic processes of relevance to archaeological research on the pre-colonial irrigation system at engaruka, tanzania. Although archaeological studies have been carried out in engaruka for several decades, geophysical processes have not been in focus, despite having the potential to contribute to the understanding of both the ancient irrigation system and the current land use in engaruka. Geomorphology and pedology were explored through field surveys and mapping using air photos and satellite images. The effects of the flash-flood during the 1997-1998 el nino were mapped and quantified in the field. Maximum flash-flood discharge in engaruka river was estimated using marming's equation. The geomorphic study revealed that engaruka is an environment where high-magnitude processes (debris flows, flash-floods, rock slides) dominate landform development. Low-magnitude processes (sheet-wash, wind erosion), transfer fine-textured sediment to low terrain, causing successive coarsening of soil texture in fields of the ancient irrigation system. Andisol occurrence in the dry environment is associated with current irrigation, indicating incremental improvement of arable land resulting from human land use. Andisols appear transient, discontinuation of irrigation has caused a reversion to entisols, as water retention and structure deteriorate upon drying. A flash-flood during the 1997-1998 el nino caused destruction of parts of the archaeological remains, with severe impact on current land use and settlements. Approximately 80 ha (4\%) of the total area of the ancient remains were covered by debris flow deposits and alluvium, or scoured by new drainage lines of the water courses. The denudation caused by the single flash-flood is estimated to 9 mm in the catchment of engaruka river. Manning's equation yielded a least possible maximum discharge in engaruka river, in the order of 270 m(3)/s, some 600-700 times higher than normal, dry season discharge.",EL NINO; FLASH-FLOOD; SOIL; IRRIGATION; TANZANIA; ENGARUKA,AFRICAN RIFT SYSTEM; NORTHERN TANZANIA; CENTRAL APPALACHIANS; DEBRIS FLOWS; EAST-AFRICA; LANDSCAPE; SECTOR; IMPACT; EVENT; KENYA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"AAREA, 2017, AAREA ARCH AGR RES E.;[ANONYMOUS], 905 WMO.;ANYAMBA A, 2002, J CLIMATE, V15, P3096, DOI 10.1175/1520-0442(2002)015<3096:FENOTL>2.0.CO,2.;BAKER VR, 1987, J HYDROL, V96, P79, DOI 10.1016/0022-1694(87)90145-4.;BROOKFIELD H, 2001, ASIA PACIFIC VIEWPOI, V42, P181, DOI DOI 10.1111/1467-8373.00143.;CHOROWICZ J, 2005, J AFR EARTH SCI, V43, P379, DOI 10.1016/J.JAFREARSCI.2005.07.019.;CHOW V.

68,Martinez Ibarra E,A geographical approach to post-flood analysis: the extreme flood event of 12 october 2007 in calpe (spain),APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,"The study demonstrates the importance, in general, of adopting a geographical (integral) approach and local analysis to determine flood risk in small mediterranean basins, where normally there is no surface runoff. At the same time, it highlights the possibilities afforded by a post-flood study. More specifically, the study seeks to identify the factors that aggravated the impact of the extreme flood event in the tourist town of calpe (alicante, spain) on 12 october 2007. Our results stress the high volume of discharge that can be generated by small basins in the mediterranean following intense rainfall events that may exceed 200 mm/day. For the 4.6 km(2) drainage network studied here, we calculate a maximum discharge of 143 m(3)/s, for a return period of 500 years. This natural risk (high potential discharge in what are usually dry basins) is exacerbated by the socioeconomic transformations that have taken place along the mediterranean coast. The expansion of urban land use has increased vulnerability to flooding in highly attractive tourist zones that are now at high risk of flooding. The municipal area recognised as presenting a class ``2 qualitative vulnerability (on a scale from 1 to 6, where 1 is the most vulnerable) rose from 1\% to 34\% between 1956 and 2002. Changes to the basins and the traditional drainage systems in endorheic zones have also increased vulnerability to flood events. For example, the area occupied by the mouth of the main basin analysed here has fallen from 2.4 ha in 1956 to just 0.7 ha in 2002. The study's main conclusions point to the need to introduce hydrological monitoring networks in small drainage systems in ephemeral river basins. It also stresses the importance of implementing structural actions to facilitate surface runoff discharge. In the mid-to-long term we conclude that there should be a declassification of urban land use zones at high risk of flooding. Moreover, detailed (local) studies which adopt an integral approach in their post-flood analyses should be undertaken to identify levels of flood risk and the appropriate land use regulations required.

77,Faccini F;Luino F;Paliaga G;Sacchini A;Turconi L;De Jong C,"Role of rainfall intensity and urban sprawl in the 2014 flash flood in genoa city, bisagno catchment (liguria, italy)",APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,"Flash floods are typical for the mediterranean region, however they have been recurring at increasing frequency over the past few decades especially over the italian peninsula. The region of genoa has recently moved into the international spotlight due to frequent and disastrous flash floods of the bisagno river and its tributaries as a result of intense autumn rainfall and dense floodplain urbanization. The last flood events even caused loss in human lives, with 6 casualties in 2011 and 1 in 2014. However, it has not yet been investigated whether the increase in these flash flood events is due to a change in rainfall regime or due to urban expansion in areas prone to flash floods. This study investigates the meteorological conditions and the ground effects of the bisagno river flash flood of october 9th, 2014 in the city of genoa. Application of a standard anomaly index and a cluster analysis reveals a positive trend in intense and short-duration rainfall recorded in the bisagno valley for the period of 1945-2016. Urban sprawl in the catchment, assessed through a multi-temporal cartographic and photographic comparison, highlights the progressive and total consumption of land in the floodplain. In the river basin surrounding genoa the risk of flash floods has increased, both due to a change in rainfall regime and associated increase in discharge but also due to increased vulnerability caused by progressive urban expansion and land use change, including in particular transformations of the bisagno riverbed. The results obtained demonstrate the need for urgent action to mitigate flood risk by introducing, amongst other measures, a citizen observatory for early warning of flash floods.",FLASH FLOOD RISK;

499,Hofmann J;Schuettrumpf H,Risk-based early warning system for pluvial flash floods: approaches and foundations,GEOSCIENCES,"In times of increasing weather extremes and expanding vulnerable cities, a significant risk to civilian security is posed by heavy rainfall induced flash floods. In contrast to river floods, pluvial flash floods can occur anytime, anywhere and vary enormously due to both terrain and climate factors. Current early warning systems (ews) are based largely on measuring rainfall intensity or monitoring water levels, whereby the real danger due to urban torrential floods is just as insufficiently considered as the vulnerability of the physical infrastructure. For this reason, this article presents a concept for a risk-based ews as one integral component of a multi-functional pluvial flood information system (mpfis). Taking both the pluvial flood hazard as well as the damage potential into account, the ews identifies the urban areas particularly affected by a forecasted heavy rainfall event and issues object-precise warnings in real-time. Further, the mpfis performs a georeferenced documentation of occurred events as well as a systematic risk analysis, which at the same time forms the foundation of the proposed ews. Based on a case study in the german city of aachen and the event of 29 may 2018, the operation principle of the integrated information system is illustrated.",FLASH FLOOD; PLUVIAL FLOODING; URBAN FLOOD; EARLY WARNING SYSTEM; MULTIFUNCTIONAL INFORMATION SYSTEM; FLOOD RISK ASSESSMENT; HAZARD ANALYSIS; REAL-TIME INFORMATION SYSTEM; HYDRODYNAMIC NUMERICAL MODEL; URBAN FLOOD MODELLING,ROAD NETWORK,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,4,none,"HOFMANN, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN, INST HYDRAUL ENGN \& WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT, D-57074 AACHEN, GERMANY.;HOFMANN, JULIAN, SCHUETTRUMPF, HOLGER, RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN, INST HYDRAUL ENGN \& WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT, D-57074 AACHEN, GERMANY.",10.3390/GEOSCIENCES9030127,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,,,2076-3263,3,,MDPI,9,2019,ISI000464447800001,62,GEOLOGY,3,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY",HOFMANNIWW.RWTH-AACHEN.DE SCHUETTRUMPFIWW.RWTH-AACHEN.DE,,HT3ET,,"HOFMANN, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), RHEIN WESTFAL TH AACHEN, INST HYDRAUL ENGN \& WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT, D-57074 AACHEN, GERMANY",ISI,SCHUETTRUMPF,INST HYDRAUL ENGN AND WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT,,"HOFMANN J, 2019, GEOSCIENCES","HOFMANN J, 2019, GEOSCIENCES",TRUE,0,0,1,2,0,0,1_3_4,1,2
209,Kermanshah A;Derrible S;Berkelhammer M,Using climate models to estimate urban vulnerability to flash floods,JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY,"Climate change will impact urban infrastructure networks by changing precipitation patterns in a region. This study presents a novel vulnerability assessment framework for infrastructure networks against extreme rainfall-induced flash floods, with a specific application to transportation. The framework combines climate models, network science, geographical information systems (gis), and stochastic modeling to compile a vulnerability surface (vs). Daily precipitation simulations for 2006-2100 from the community climate system model, version 4 (ccsm4), are used to produce a stochastic simulation of extreme flash flood events in five u.s. Cities-that is, boston, massachusetts, houston, texas, miami, florida, oklahoma city, oklahoma, and philadelphia, pennsylvania-under two different climate scenarios (rcp4.5 and rcp8.5). To assess the impact of these events, percentage drops in static (i.e., overall properties and robustness topological indicators) and dynamic (i.e., gis accessibility and travel demand metrics) network properties are measured before and after simulated extreme events. The results of these metrics are inputs on a radar diagram to form a vs. Overall, the results show that changes in flash flood frequency due to climate change can have a significant impact on road networks, as was demonstrated recently in houston, texas. The magnitude of these impacts is chiefly associated with the geographic location of the cities and the size of the networks.

The approach presented here aims to go one step ahead by offering a direct assessment of the potential impacts of flash floods on inhabited areas. This approach is based on an a priori analysis of the considered area in order (1) to evaluate based on a semi-automatic hydraulic approach (cartino method) the potentially flooded areas for different discharge levels, and (2) to identify the associated buildings and/or population at risk based on geographic databases. This preliminary analysis enables to build a simplified impact model (discharge-impact curve) for each river reach, which can be used to directly estimate the importance of potentially affected assets based on the outputs of a distributed rainfall-runoff model. This article presents a first case study conducted in the gard region (south eastern france). The first validation results are presented in terms of (1) accuracy of the delineation of the flooded areas estimated based on the cartino method and using a high resolution dtm, and (2) relevance and usefulness of the impact model obtained. The impacts estimated at the event scale will now be evaluated in a near future based on insurance claim data provided by ccr (caisse centrale de reassurrance).",,WARNING SYSTEM; BASINS; PREDICTION; FRANCE,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,1,"AUBERT Y, 2014, HYDROLOG SCI J, V59, P993, DOI 10.1080/02626667.2014.902061.;GEORGAKAKOS KP, 2006, J HYDROL, V317, P81, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2005.05.009.;GOURLEY JJ, 2014, HYDROLOG SCI J, V59, P1377, DOI 10.1080/02626667.2014.919391.;JAVELLE P, 2014, HYDROLOG SCI J, V59, P1390, DOI 10.1080/02626667.2014.923970.;MONCOULON D, 2014, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V14, P2469, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-14-2469-2014.;NAULIN JP, 2013, J HYDROL, V486, P88, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2013.01.044.;NORBIATO D, 2008, J HYDROL, V362, P274, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2008.08.023.;PONS F, 2014, HOUILLE BLANCHE, P34, DOI 10.1051/1HB/2014014.;ROZALIS S, 2010, J HYDROL, V394, P245, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2010.03.021.;VERSINI PA, 2014, NAT HAZARDS, V71, P1355, DOI 10.1007/S11069-013-0949-7.","PAYRASTRE, O (REPRINT AUTHOR), LUNAM UNIV, DEPT GERS, LAB EAU ENVIRONM, IFSTTAR, ROUTE BOUAYE,CS4, F-44844 BOUGUENAIS, FRANCE.;LE BIHAN, GUILLAUME, PAYRASTRE, OLIVIER, GAUME, ERIC, LUNAM UNIV, DEPT GERS, LAB EAU ENVIRONM, IFSTTAR, ROUTE BOUAYE,CS4, F-44844 BOUGUENAIS, FRANCE.;MONCOULON, DAVID, CCR, 157 BLVD HAUSSMANN, F-75008 PARIS, FRANCE.;PONS, FREDERIC, CEREMA DTER MEDITERRANEE, POLE ACTIVITES LES MILLES, AVE ALBERT EINSTEIN,CS 70499, AIX EN PROVENCE 3, FRANCE.",10.1051/E3SCONF/20160718013,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE","LANG, M AND KLIJN, F AND SAMUELS, P",,,2267-1242,,,E D P SCIENCES,7,2016,ISI000392270100196,10,"ENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, GEOLOGY, PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, WATER RESOURCES",8,"ENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL, ENGINEERING, CIVIL, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, REGIONAL \& URBAN PLANNING, WATER RESOURCES",OLIVIER.PAYRASTREIFSTTAR.FR,E3S WEB OF CONFERENCES,BG8GU,3RD EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT (FLOODRISK 2016),"PAYRASTRE, O (REPRINT AUTHOR), LUNAM UNIV, DEPT GERS, LAB EAU ENVIRONM, IFSTTAR, ROUTE BOUAYE,CS4, F-44844 BOUGUENAIS, FRANCE",ISI,LUNAM UNIV;AVE ALBERT EINSTEIN,LUNAM UNIV,,"LE BIHAN G, 2016, 3RD EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT (FLOODRISK 2016)","LE BIHAN G, 2016, 3RD EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT (FLOODRISK 2016)",FALSE,2,0,0,1,0,6,1_3_4,0,2

A flood risk matrix is developed based on the flood occurrence probability and the associated inundation depth. The risk matrix criterion is classified according to the degree of risks as high, moderate and low. The case study has indicted low to moderate risk for flood frequencies of 5 years return periods and moderate to high risk may exist for flood with rerun period of 50 and 100 years. The results are projected on a two-dimensional satellite images that shows the geographical locations exposed to flooding.

The purpose of the present research is the anticipation of hydrological risk in this type of areas in case of a simultaneous occurrence of two types of hazard: torrential rain and damages to the supply water system network. Therefore we will use an arcgis procedure of building flash-floods scenarios generated by extreme events, namely the high level of soil saturation, damages to the supply water system network and a high intensity torrential rain. The article presents different scenarios according to the return period (t) of the torrential rain: t=20 years, t=100 years and t=1000 years. The results will highlight the several vulnerability categories of the terrain and households related to combined risk.

This paper presents a scenario-based study that assesses the school vulnerability of emergency services (i.e., emergency medical service and fire \& rescue service) to urban pluvial flooding in the city center of shanghai, china through the combination of flood hazard analysis and gis-based accessibility mapping. Emergency coverages and response times in various traffic conditions are quantified to generate school vulnerability under normal no-flood and 100-y pluvial flood scenarios. The findings indicate that severe pluvial flooding could lead to proportionate and linear impacts on emergency response provision to schools in the city. Only 11\% of all the schools is predicted to be completely unreachable (very high vulnerability) during flood emergency but the majority of the schools would experience significant delay in the travel times of emergency responses. In this case, appropriate adaptations need to be particularly targeted for specific hot-spot areas (e.g., new urbanized zones) and crunch times (e.g., rush hours).",EMERGENCY RESPONSE; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; SCHOOLS AND STUDENTS; PLUVIAL FLOODING; SHANGHAI,RISK-ASSESSMENT; ROAD NETWORK; FLASH-FLOOD; IMPACT; ACCESSIBILITY; DISASTER; URBANIZATION; PREPAREDNESS; MANAGEMENT; POLICIES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"LIAO, BG (REPRINT AUTHOR), SHANGHAI NORMAL UNIV, SCH ENVIRONM \& GEOG SCI, SHANGHAI 200234, PEOPLES R CHINA.;YIN, JIE, EAST CHINA NORMAL UNIV, FAC EDUC, SHANGHAI 200062, PEOPLES R CHINA.;YIN, JIE, JING, YAMENG, YE, MINGWU, YANG, YUHAN, EAST CHINA NORMAL UNIV, MINIST EDUC, KEY LAB GEOG INFORMAT SCI, SHANGHAI 200241, PEOPLES R CHINA.;YIN, JIE, EAST CHINA NORMAL UNIV, INST ECOCHONGMING, SHANGHAI 200062, PEOPLES R CHINA.;YU, DAPENG, LOUGHBOROUGH UNIV, DEPT GEOG, LOUGHBOROUGH LE11 3TU, LEICS, ENGLAND.;LIAO, BANGGU, SHANGHAI NORMAL UNIV, SCH ENVIRONM \& GEOG SCI, SHANGHAI 200234, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.3390/SU11020349,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,"PEAK DISCIPLINE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT OF EDUCATION AT EAST CHINA NORMAL UNIVERSITY; NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [41871164, 41601568, 51761135024]; NATIONAL SOCIAL SCIENCE FUND OF CHINA [18ZDA105]; NATIONAL KEY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM OF CHINA [2017YFE0100700, 2017YFE0107400]; HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCE PROJECT OF EDUCATION MINISTRY OF CHINA [17YJAZH111]; NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF SHANGHAINATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF SHANGHAI [18ZR1410800]; FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR THE CENTRAL UNIVERSITIESFUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR THE CENTRAL UNIVERSITIES [2018ECNU-QKT001, 2017ECNU-KXK013]",,2071-1050,2,,MDPI,11,2019,ISI000457129900053,38,"SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY",6,"GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES",JYINGEO.ECNU.EDU.CN 51163901054STU.ECNU.EDU.CN D.YU2LBORO.AC.UK MWYEADMIN.ECNU.EDU.CN 51183901022STU.ECNU.EDU.CN LIAOMAPSHNU.EDU.CN,,HJ4FR,,"LIAO, BG (REPRINT AUTHOR), SHANGHAI NORMAL UNIV, SCH ENVIRONM \& GEOG SCI, SHANGHAI 200234, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,EAST CHINA NORMAL UNIV;EAST CHINA NORMAL UNIV;EAST CHINA NORMAL UNIV;LOUGHBOROUGH UNIV;SHANGHAI NORMAL UNIV,SHANGHAI NORMAL UNIV,,"YIN J, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY","YIN J, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY",FALSE,1,0,2,0,2,0,1_3_4,1,2

Also, those processes can cause casualties and damage socioeconomic structures (roads, railways, houses, etc.) The processes intercept protected landscapes, sometimes endangering protected species and habitats. The restoration of the streambed's stability in protected areas and the protection of the economic objectives affected by the torrential floods, imply special measures of planning. The planning measures are based on the use of ecological materials and technologies with minimal impact on the environment. The article presents a methodology for identifying small river basins with high torrential risk and the endangered economic objectives, as well as applying this methodology into three natura 2000 sites from central romania (rosci0207 postavaru, rosci0195 piatra mare and rosci 0038 ciucas). Identification of the basins was made considering their geomorphological and hydrological characteristics and the vulnerability of the intercepted socio-economic objectives. Into identified watershed, measurements of the streambed topography and the geometric characteristics of the endangered structures were made. Based on hydraulic simulations, maps were generated for floods with a 100-year return period. Using these flood maps, the maximum water level was determined to highlight the flood risk areas for each socioeconomics structural objective. In areas identified as floodplain, special structural and nonstructural solutions are proposed for guiding water into convenient paths to avoid the endangered structures. (C) 2019 elsevier b.v.

This paper examines flood hazards in the rapidly urbanizing catchment of al-aysen in riyadh. Remote sensing and geographic information system techniques were employed to obtain and prepare input data for hydrologic and hydraulic models, with the former based on the very popular curve number approach. Due to the limited nature of the rainfall data, observations from two rain gauges in the vicinity of the catchment were used to estimate design storms. The hydrologic model was run in a semi-distributed mode by dividing the catchment into many sub-catchments. The impact of urbanization on run-off volume and peak discharge resulting from different storms was investigated, with various urbanization scenarios simulated. Flood hazard zones and affected streets were also identified through hydrologic/hydraulic model simulation. The mismatch between administrative and catchment boundaries can create problems in flood risk management for similar cities since hydrologic processes and flood hazards are based on the hydrologic connectivity. Since flooding events impact the road network and create driving hazards, governmental decision-makers must take the necessary precautions to protect drivers in these situations.",,FLASH FLOODS; INUNDATION; VALLEY; FRANCE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,16,"AL-GABBANI M, 1991, GEOJOURNAL, V24, P375.;ALAHMADI K, 2008, ECOL COMPLEX, V6, P80.;ALGARNI D.

488,Gao L;Zhang L;Li X;Zhou S,Evaluating metropolitan flood coping capabilities under heavy storms,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,"A large city surrounded by mountains like hong kong is susceptible to both flash floods in midmountain areas and local flooding in low-lying areas when a large rainstorm occurs. Severe rainstorms tend to be more frequent under a changing climate. Hence, it is essential to simulate rainfall-runoff processes in the urban area and evaluate flood coping strategies. This paper presents a model that is capable of simulating the overland flow process and underground drainage hydraulics simultaneously, based on detailed topographic, rainfall, and drainage network information about the northern hong kong island. The model was calibrated with a flood-extent map and further validated with a flood event in june 2008. Using the model, the flood hazards associated with flood coping projects in three phases were simulated. Although these flooding control measures were intended to meet a major societal need for alleviating flooding problems and are shown to be effective in alleviating local flooding, the densely urbanized area may still suffer flooding when severe storm events occur. Hence, new strategies are needed to cope with the urban flood risk under more critical storms.",METROPOLITAN FLOODING; STORMWATER; DRAINAGE NETWORK; HYDROLOGIC MODELING; CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACT,RIVER; MODEL,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,none,"ZHANG, LM (REPRINT AUTHOR), HONG KONG UNIV SCI \& TECHNOL, DEPT CIVIL \& ENVIRONM ENGN, CLEAR WATER BAY, HONG KONG, PEOPLES R CHINA.;GAO, LIANG, ZHANG, LIMIN, LI, XUEYOU, ZHOU, SHENGYANG, HONG KONG UNIV SCI \& TECHNOL, DEPT CIVIL \& ENVIRONM ENGN, CLEAR WATER BAY, HONG KONG, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0001793,"1801 ALEXANDER BELL DR, RESTON, VA 20191-4400 USA",,RESEARCH GRANTS COUNCIL OF THE HONG KONG SAR GOVERNMENTHONG KONG RESEARCH GRANTS COUNCIL [16206217],,1084-0699,6,,ASCE-AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,24,2019,ISI000464572000004,42,"ENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, WATER RESOURCES",16,"ENGINEERING, CIVIL, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",LIANG.GAO-1OU.EDU CEZHANGLUST.HK LIXUEYOUUST.HK SZHOUAQCONNECT.UST.HK,,HT4ZN,,"ZHANG, LM (REPRINT AUTHOR), HONG KONG UNIV SCI \& TECHNOL, DEPT CIVIL \& ENVIRONM ENGN, CLEAR WATER BAY, HONG KONG, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,HONG KONG UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,HONG KONG UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,,"GAO L, 2019, J HYDROL ENG","GAO L, 2019, J HYDROL ENG",TRUE,1_2,6,0,0,0,0,1_3_4,1,2

We conducted interdisciplinary research by integrating flood modeling and traffic analysis to reveal the spatiotemporal pattern of the interplay between these two processes. A simplified simulation tool, which is capable of building a road network model, assigning trip paths with the effect of road closures, and evaluating travel delay and vehicle volume redistribution in a given pff scenario, was developed to capture the traffic disruption in the face of pff events. Modeling outputs from a case study in the city center of shanghai showed that the delay of vehicles diverted to dry links or trapped in flooded links may reach 0.5 to 8 times the travel time in no-flood scenarios. Overall, approximately 1-7\% of vehicle volumes on flooded links would be redistributed onto dry links (more likely major arterial roads). However, the vehicle volume variation during each time interval demonstrated evident disparity with the spatiotemporal change of flood inundations. Simulating and mapping the congestion can largely facilitate the identification of vulnerable links. Future research will test the method in other intra-urban areas and try to bridge the gap between modeling outputs and smart city planning and management.",,IMPACT; TRAVEL,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"AL HASSAN Y, 1999, J TRANSP GEOGR, V7, P209, DOI DOI 10.1016/S0966-6923(98)00047-7.;CHANG H, 2010, ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR, V100, P938, DOI 10.1080/00045608.2010.497110.;CHEN XW, 2008, PROF GEOGR, V60, P160, DOI 10.1080/00330120701873645.;CHOWDHURY S, 2015, J TRANSP GEOGR, V43, P151, DOI 10.1016/J.JTRANGEO.2015.01.009.;DATLA S, 2008, J TRANSP GEOGR, V16, P358, DOI 10.1016/J.JTRANGEO.2007.12.003.;KHISTY C.

400,Graf R;Jawgiel K,The impact of the parameterisation of physiographic features of urbanised catchment areas on the spatial distribution of components of the water balance using the wetspass model,ISPRS INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GEO-INFORMATION,"An analysis was conducted of the activity of individual homogeneous hydrological response units (hrus) and their impact on the components of the spatially distributed water balance based on the example of two urbanised catchments of the city of poznan (western poland). Water balance was developed using the wetspass model and gis spatial data, based on hydrometeorological data from the reference period of 1961-2000 including projected land usage changes and precipitation changes expected by 2025 in the city. The catchments were parameterised with reference to land usage, soil permeability, terrain declivities and the level of groundwater waters in summer and winter. The dependence between hrus and their impact on components of the water balance was determined. Water balance forecasts have shown two-way changes in the components of approximately 12\% of the catchments. A significant increase of surface runoff (an increase of 20-30 mm/hru) at the expense of effective infiltration reduction (by 15-20 mm/hru) was determined for arable land intended for development. An increase of infiltration and evapotranspiration at the expense of the surface runoff reduction is forecast for areas designed for urban afforestation. The tendency of increase of atmospheric precipitation within the city until 2025 was indicated by changes in the water balance components. Changes in the landscape resulting from urban expansion may lead to detrimental hydrological effects: accumulation of surface runoffs and occurrence of local flash flooding, as confirmed by the simulations carried out using the wetspass model. The results may contribute to a more accurate understanding of the impact of urban landscape modification patterns on the water balance at the regional and local scale.",WATER BALANCE; WETSPASS MODEL; HYDROLOGICAL RESPONSE UNIT; URBANISED CATCHMENT; SPATIAL DEVELOPMENT; FORECAST,GROUNDWATER RECHARGE ESTIMATION; SUSTAINABILITY; IMPERVIOUSNESS; SYSTEMS; KANSAS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"ABU-SALEEM A., 2010, JOURNAL OF AGRONOMY, V9, P119, DOI 10.3923/JA.2010.119.125.;AISH AM, 2010, ARAB J SCI ENG, V35, P155.;AKAN AO, 2003, URBAN HYDROLOGY HYDR.;AL KUISI M, 2013, REV MEX CIENC GEOL, V30, P96.;AREFAINE T, 2012, MOMONA ETHIOP J SCI, V4, P96.;ASFAW M.

451,Li Y;Li Hx;Huang J;Liu C,An approximation method for evaluating flash flooding mitigation of sponge city strategies - a case study of central geelong,JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION,"Urban flooding is a severe problem and a growing development challenge for many cities around the world. Therefore, there is an urgent need to introduce mitigation measures through managing rainwater to reduce these risks. The sponge city system is regarded as an effective mechanism to manage rainwater and reduce flooding, as it is capable of promoting infiltration and retaining rainwater. However, the main challenge is how to efficiently quantify and visualise the flooding mitigation effects of a sponge city project with various technical measures. There is also a lack of cost analysis of sponge city strategies to reduce risks of a large-scale urban project. Thus, this paper aims to evaluate and visualise mitigation effects from sponge city strategies on urban floods. This paper establishes a rapid and simplified modelling framework for assessing the approximate effects of sponge city strategies on flooding mitigation through gis simulation in a real-world environment. Various sponge city elements, such as green roofs and wetlands, are systematically integrated in a rainfall-runoff model. Central geelong will be used as a case study. Scenarios are created in terms of project expenditure, green benefit and infiltration. With the gis mapping technologies and matlab-based digital image processing, maps presenting results for the proposed scenarios are displayed to visualise the mitigation effects of the strategies on urban flooding inundation. The results reveal that the sponge city strategies are capable of generating varying degrees of mitigation of urban flash floods. The scenario with the largest infiltration volume has shown the most significant effect on the flooding mitigation, such as a reduction of 80\% in the runoff volume during a one-in-50-year rainfall event, but it may cost twice as much as other options. Overall, this study could be applied to rapid assessment measures of sponge city strategies in the flooding control and decision making on urban green infrastructure planning. The approach proposed here could be adopted for disaster mitigation though sponge city technologies. (C) 2020 elsevier ltd.

87,Yang W;Xu K;Lian J;Ma C;Bin L,Integrated flood vulnerability assessment approach based on topsis and shannon entropy methods,ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"Flood vulnerability assessment is becoming increasingly important around the world. Nevertheless, the high dimensional and non-linear relationship between various indices and flood vulnerability greatly hinders researchers from making a reasonable assessment. Thus, an integrated flood vulnerability assessment approach is proposed here by combining a multi-criteria decision making technique, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (topsis), with the shannon entropy method. The shannon entropy method is used to account for the inhomogeneity in the indicator values. Topsis uses a multi-criteria system where hydrodynamic modeling is applied to obtain the values of exposure indicators. This approach is tested in a rural district of hainan province, china. The flood vulnerability at the town and administrative village scales is presented through a geographic information system. By considering the inhomogeneity of the internal attributes, the integrated assessment approach is eventually proven as a highly realistic approach for assessing flood vulnerability. The advantages of this approach become highly pronounced when the evaluation objects have more internal indicators and the internal inhomogeneity among the values of these indicators is high. The main driving factors of flood vulnerability in one district has also been successfully identified using the proposed integrated method. In sum, this integrated assessment method can provide decision makers with highly targeted decision making references to effectively reduce the flood vulnerability of the study area.",FLOOD VULNERABILITY; INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT; TOPSIS; SHANNON ENTROPY METHOD; HYDRODYNAMIC MODEL; MULTI-INDICES SYSTEM; INHOMOGENEITY,SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE-CHANGE; FLASH-FLOOD; ADAPTIVE CAPACITY; RISK; HAZARDS; PERFORMANCE; ADAPTATION; EXPOSURE; LESSONS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,15,"ADGER WN, 2006, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V16, P268, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2006.02.006.;ADLER M., 1996, GAZING ORACLE DELPHI.;BROOKS N, 2005, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V15, P151, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2004.12.006.;CHANG CH, 2011, NAT HAZARDS, V56, P667, DOI 10.1007/S11069-010-9581-Y.;CHANG LF, 2015, LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN, V143, P11, DOI 10.1016/J.LANDURBPLAN.2015.06.004.;CHEN SM, 2016, INFORM SCIENCES, V367, P279, DOI 10.1016/J.INS.2016.05.044.;CHUNG ES, 2017, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V9, DOI 10.3390/SU9010029.;CUTTER SL, 2003, SOC SCI QUART, V84, P242, DOI 10.1111/1540-6237.8402002.;DEB M, 2016, ENERGY, V117, P281, DOI 10.1016/J.ENERGY.2016.10.088.;DOOCY S., 2013, PLOS CURRENTS, V5.;FEKETE A, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P393, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-393-2009.;FELL R, 2008, ENG GEOL, V102, P85, DOI 10.1016/J.ENGGEO.2008.03.022.;GOVINDAN K, 2013, J CLEAN PROD, V47, P345, DOI 10.1016/J.JCLEPRO.2012.04.014.;HIRABAYASHI Y, 2013, NAT CLIM CHANGE, V3, P816, DOI [10.1038/NCLIMATE1911, 10.1038/NCLIMATE1911].;HUANG DP, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V64, P1575, DOI 10.1007/S11069-012-0323-1.;KABLAN MKA, 2017, WATER-SUI, V9, DOI 10.3390/W9040292.;KARAGIORGOS K, 2016, J HYDROL, V541, P553, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2016.02.052.;KARAMOUZ M., 2017, J WATER RESOUR PLAN, V143.;KARIM F, 2016, HYDROL PROCESS, V30, P1574, DOI 10.1002/HYP.10714.;KHAGRAM S., 2003, J HUMAN DEV, V4, P289, DOI [DOI 10.1080/1464988032000087604, 10.1080/1464988032000087604].;KIND J, 2017, WIRES CLIM CHANGE, V8, DOI 10.1002/WCC.446.;KOKS EE, 2015, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V47, P42, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2014.10.013.;LIAN JJ, 2017, NAT HAZARDS, V88, P699, DOI 10.1007/S11069-017-2887-2.;[ MA DINGGUO], 2007, [, ACTA GEOGRAPHICA SINICA], V62, P321.;MAO J, 2017, ISPRS INT J GEO-INF, V6, DOI 10.3390/IJGI6060162.;MAO N, 2016, APPL ENERG, V180, P536, DOI 10.1016/J.APENERGY.2016.08.011.;MCELWEE P, 2017, NAT HAZARDS, V86, P465, DOI 10.1007/S11069-016-2701-6.;METZGER MJ, 2006, AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON, V114, P69, DOI 10.1016/J.AGEE.2005.11.025.;OUMA YO, 2014, WATER-SUI, V6, P1515, DOI 10.3390/W6061515.;PENG C, 2017, ROBOT CIM-INT MANUF, V43, P96, DOI 10.1016/J.RCIM.2015.10.011.;PETER L.J., 2009, PETER PRINCIPLE WHY.;RAHMAN MT, 2016, NAT HAZARDS, V84, P1807, DOI 10.1007/S11069-016-2521-8.;ROSIC M, 2017, ACCIDENT ANAL PREV, V98, P277, DOI 10.1016/J.AAP.2016.10.007.;SHANNON CE, 1948, BELL SYST TECH J, V27, P623, DOI 10.1002/J.1538-7305.1948.TB00917.X.;SUBHANKAR KARMAKAR, 2010, JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM, V2, P129.;SWART R.J., 2012, URBAN VULNERABILITY.;SZLAFSZTEIN CLAUDIO, 2007, JOURNAL OF COASTAL CONSERVATION, V11, P53, DOI 10.1007/S11852-007-0003-6.;TAPSELL SM, 2002, PHILOS T ROY SOC A, V360, P1511, DOI 10.1098/RSTA.2002.1013.;TURNER BL, 2003, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V100, P8074, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.1231335100.;WEIS SWM, 2016, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V136, P615, DOI 10.1007/S10584-016-1642-0.;YIN J, 2016, J HYDROL, V537, P138, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2016.03.037.","XU, K (REPRINT AUTHOR), TIANJIN UNIV, STATE KEY LAB HYDRAUL ENGN SIMULAT \& SAFETY, TIANJIN 300350, PEOPLES R CHINA.;YANG, WEICHAO, XU, KUI, LIAN, JIJIAN, MA, CHAO, TIANJIN UNIV, STATE KEY LAB HYDRAUL ENGN SIMULAT \& SAFETY, TIANJIN 300350, PEOPLES R CHINA.;YANG, WEICHAO, XU, KUI, LIAN, JIJIAN, MA, CHAO, BIN, LINGLING, TIANJIN UNIV, SCH CIVIL ENGN, TIANJIN 300350, PEOPLES R CHINA.;BIN, LINGLING, TIANJIN UNIV, FRONTIER TECHNOL RES INST, TIANJIN 300350, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.1016/J.ECOLIND.2018.02.015,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,"NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [51509179, 51679159, U1765202]; SCIENCE FUND FOR CREATIVE RESEARCH GROUPS OF THE NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [51621092]; TIANJIN MUNICIPAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONNATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF TIANJIN [17JCQNJC08900]; PROGRAM OF INTRODUCING TALENTS OF DISCIPLINE TO UNIVERSITIES [B14012]",,1470-160X,,269-280,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,89,2018,ISI000430760900026,41,"BIODIVERSITY \& CONSERVATION, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY",43,"BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES",JACKYKUI126.COM,,GD8KI,,"XU, K (REPRINT AUTHOR), TIANJIN UNIV, STATE KEY LAB HYDRAUL ENGN SIMULAT \& SAFETY, TIANJIN 300350, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,TIANJIN UNIV;TIANJIN UNIV;TIANJIN UNIV,TIANJIN UNIV,,"YANG W, 2018, ECOL INDIC","YANG W, 2018, ECOL INDIC",FALSE,1,0,2,0,0,0,1_3_4_11,2,1

Hence mapping of flash floods would be useful in identifying the high-risk flood zones for disaster response and urban services, during emergencies with rainfall events of high intensity. This article aims to prepare a flood hazard map of warangal municipal corporation (wmc) in telangana state, india. Wmc is chronically affected due to a rise in water levels resulting in flash floods, with an increase in encroachments. The factors considered in this study are rainfall (curve number), surface slope and surface roughness, type of soil, and distance to main channel, drainage density, and land use cover. To decide the relative weight of the impact of each flood causative factors an analytical hierarchical process (ahp) was used. Accordingly, a composite flood hazard index (fhi) has been derived by using the multiple-criteria decision-making tools by integrating these into a geographical information system (gis). The soil and water assessment tool (swat) in quantum gis (qgis), which is a hydrological model, was used to evaluate the projection of streamflow over the water basin and model parameters were optimized using water balance equations during calibration and validation periods.",REMOTE SENSING; GIS; RUNOFF; MULTICRITERIA DECISION ANALYSIS; ANALYTICAL HIERARCHICAL PROCESS; FLOOD HAZARD INDEX,RISK ANALYSIS; GIS; VULNERABILITY; MODELS; AREAS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"BANDI, AS (REPRINT AUTHOR), NATL INST TECHNOL, DEPT CIVIL ENGN, WARANGAL 506004, TELANGANA, INDIA.;BANDI, ANEESHA SATYA, MESHAPAM, SHASHI, DEVA, PRATAP, NATL INST TECHNOL, DEPT CIVIL ENGN, WARANGAL 506004, TELANGANA, INDIA.",10.2478/ENVIRON-2019-0013,"DE GRUYTER POLAND SP Z O O, BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A STR, 01-811 WARSAW, POLAND",,,,2354-0079,3,1-13,SCIENDO,7,2019,ISI000488263900001,39,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,1,ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES,ANEESHATYAGMAIL.COM,,JB0RL,,"BANDI, AS (REPRINT AUTHOR), NATL INST TECHNOL, DEPT CIVIL ENGN, WARANGAL 506004, TELANGANA, INDIA",ISI,NATL INST TECHNOL,NATL INST TECHNOL,,"BANDI AS, 2019, ENVIRON SOCIO-ECON STUD","BANDI AS, 2019, ENVIRON SOCIO-ECON STUD",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,0,1_3_4_11,1,2

Detailed summarization is conducted based on four types of regional flood risk assessment methods, including (i) statistical methods, (ii) multi-criteria analysis, (iii) analysis using geographical information system (gis) and/or remote sensing (rs), and (iv) scenario-based analysis. After reviewing of the existing methods in literatures, a perspective approach of evaluating inundation risk for metro systems is proposed. The proposed approach has the following two characteristics: (i) from regional to local, and (ii) from qualification to quantification. The guangzhou metro system is used to demonstrate the application of the perspective methods for flood risk assessment of metro system. The risk prevention procedure uses an iterative cycle that includes risk assessment, precaution, prediction, and technical countermeasures. The integration of gis, global position system (gps) and build information modelling (bim) for development of early warning and risk management systems is recommended to manage the risks of inundation of metro system.",FLOOD RISK; ASSESSMENT METHOD; METRO SYSTEM,MULTICRITERIA DECISION-MAKING; ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; URBAN UNDERGROUND SPACE; MONTE-CARLO-SIMULATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; HAZARD ASSESSMENT; GROUNDWATER SEEPAGE; ROLLING CORRECTION; SUBWAY STATION; FLASH-FLOOD,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,49,none,"SHEN, SL (REPRINT AUTHOR), SHANGHAI JIAO TONG UNIV, SCH NAVAL ARCHITECTURE OCEAN \& CIVIL ENGN, DEPT CIVIL ENGN, STATE KEY LAB OCEAN ENGN, SHANGHAI 200240, PEOPLES R CHINA.;LYU, HAI-MIN, SHEN, SHUI-LONG, SHANGHAI JIAO TONG UNIV, SCH NAVAL ARCHITECTURE OCEAN \& CIVIL ENGN, DEPT CIVIL ENGN, STATE KEY LAB OCEAN ENGN, SHANGHAI 200240, PEOPLES R CHINA.;ZHOU, ANNAN, RMIT UNIV, SCH ENGN, CIVIL \& INFRASTRUCT DISCIPLINE, MELBOURNE, VIC 3001, AUSTRALIA.;YANG, JUN, UNIV HONG KONG, DEPT CIVIL ENGN, POKFULAM, HONG KONG, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.1016/J.TUST.2018.10.019,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",,NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA (NSFC)NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [41672259],,0886-7798,,31-44,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,84,2019,ISI000457506700004,150,"CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING",130,"CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, CIVIL",LVHAIMINSJTU.EDU.CN SLSHENSJTU.EDU.CN ANNAN.ZHOURMIT.EDU.AU JUNYANGHKU.HK,,HJ9GK,,"SHEN, SL (REPRINT AUTHOR), SHANGHAI JIAO TONG UNIV, SCH NAVAL ARCHITECTURE OCEAN \& CIVIL ENGN, DEPT CIVIL ENGN, STATE KEY LAB OCEAN ENGN, SHANGHAI 200240, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,SHANGHAI JIAO TONG UNIV;RMIT UNIV;UNIV HONG KONG,SHANGHAI JIAO TONG UNIV,,"LYU HM, 2019, TUNN UNDERGR SPACE TECHNOL","LYU HM, 2019, TUNN UNDERGR SPACE TECHNOL",FALSE,1,6,1,0,0,0,1_3_4_11,1,1

The method leverages remote sensing and gis derive estimates of measured and inferred parameters of vidor rural catchment to quantify the flash flood events of the last four years: 2014-2017. The calibration of the pcswmm is performed using the sensitivity-based radio tuning calibration (srtc) tool. The nash-sutcliffe efficiency (nse), coefficient of determination (r-2), and relative error (re) values were found between 0.75-0.97, 0.94-0.98, and -0.22--0.09 respectively. The statistical indicators prove the accuracy of pcswmm for rural catchments. The runoff response of vidor torrent is also analyzed for 0.5/12.7, 1.5/38.1, and 2.0/50.8-inch/mm rainfall hyetographs. The generated hydrographs are used to simulate 2d-module in hec-ras 5.X for floodplain demarcation in the piedmont area. The accuracy of the flood extent is analyzed using spatial overlay analogy in the arcgis environment by comparing simulated and historically available flood extents. The simulated flood extent shows 76\% accuracy with historic flood extent. The impact of flash flood events shows wheat, maize, and fruit orchards are the most effected agriculture in piedmont area.

The following maps are used: flood-prone urbanity from 1988-2019, a flood risk map of wadi nu'man based on a risk matrix map, and a map of the proposed protection measures and alternatives in the study area. In order to achieve these goals, changes in the land use in the wadi nu'man basin were monitored by analyzing successive satellite images, taken by the us satellite, landsat, in 1988, 1998, 2013, and 2019.

Therefore, this study attempts to understand the impacts of these three factors on the flash flood vulnerability in different climatic regions in egypt. An integrated approach is presented to evaluate the urban growth from 1984 to 2019 by using google images and sentinel-2 data, and to develop hazard maps by using a rainfall-runoff-inundation model (rri). Annual rainfall trend analysis was performed to evaluate the temporal variability trend. The hazard maps that were created were classified into three categories (low, medium, and high) and integrated with the urban growth maps to evaluate the impacts on the flood-vulnerable areas. The results show a significant increase in urban growth resulting in an increase of prone areas for flood hazards over time. However, the degree of this hazard is mainly related to growth directions. Mismanagement affects urban growth directions in both planned and unplanned growth, whether by loss of control over unplanned growth or by deficiencies in approved plans. The rainfall analysis showed that there is no explicit relationship to increases or decreases in the flood vulnerable areas.

The standardized assessment of multiple hazards and their potential impacts is crucial, in terms of risk management, for those coastal areas where both marine and fluvial hazards can occur. Nevertheless, in bocca di magra (liguria region, italy), where both coastal and fluvial flooding can occur, up until now the potential impacts from marine flooding have not been thought to be of importance, only the impact of fluvial flooding has been systematically analysed. Now, however, the liguria regional stakeholders have become interested in understanding the potential impact of marine inundations compared to fluvial inundations, applying the craf (coastal risk assessment framework) methodology developed inside the risc-kit project. The hazard modelling of coastal and fluvial inundations was used, together with exposure data, to evaluate the direct and systemic impacts generated by both flooding mechanisms separately. An end-user-driven multi criteria analysis was implemented to compare coastal and fluvial impacts on the same area. For an event with a 1 in 200 year return period, the craf predicts that fluvial inundation generates higher impacts, in comparison to the marine one. Even though the impacts in the coastal area are less, the impacted exposed elements are different from those impacted by fluvial inundation and none of them can be excluded from the analysis. This work highlights the need for regional managers to develop combined coastal-fluvial flooding assessments, such actions should be seen as a priority for flood disaster risk management in locations affected by both marine flooding and riverine flash flooding.",CRAF; FLOOD IMPACTS; FLUVIAL FLOOD; COASTAL FLOOD; LIGURIA REGION,EXAMPLE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,"[ANONYMOUS], 2013, CLIMATE CHANGE 2013.;[ANONYMOUS], 2012, MAPPATURA PERICOLOSI.;[ANONYMOUS], 2014, MAPPATURA PERICOLOSI.;ARMAROLI C., 2017, COAST ENG IN PRESS.;BATES PD, 2005, COAST ENG, V52, P793, DOI 10.1016/J.COASTALENG.2005.06.001.;DUFOUR S, 2015, LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN, V134, P107, DOI 10.1016/J.LANDURBPLAN.2014.10.007.;DUO E., 2015, RISC KIT DELIVERABLE.;EDF, 2000, TELEMAC 2D VAL DOC V.;FEMA, 2015, TECHNICAL MANUAL.;FLOODSITE, 2008, GUID COAST FLOOD HAZ.;GAUME E, 2009, J HYDROL, V367, P70, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2008.12.028.;HAJKOWICZ S, 2008, EUR J OPER RES, V184, P255, DOI 10.1016/J.EJOR.2006.10.045.;HOLMAN RA, 1986, COAST ENG, V9, P527, DOI 10.1016/0378-3839(86)90002-5.;LLASAT M.C., 2010, ADV GEOSCI, V26, P105, DOI DOI 10.5194/ADGE0-26-105-2010.;OWEN M.

Increasing extreme precipitation events will likely lead to greater human and economic losses unless reliable and efficient early warning systems (ews) along with other adaptation actions are put in place in urban areas. The challenge is in the integration and analysis in time and space of the environmental, meteorological, and territorial data from multiple sources needed to build up ews able to provide efficient contribution to increase the resilience of vulnerable and exposed urban communities to flooding. Efficient ews contribute to the preparedness phase of the disaster cycle but could also be relevant in the planning of the emergency phase. The rainbo life project addressed this matter, focusing on the improvement of knowledge, methods, and tools for the monitoring and forecast of extreme precipitation events and the assessment of the associated flood risk for small and medium watercourses in urban areas. To put this into practice, rainbo developed a webgis platform, which contributes to the ``planning of the management of river flood events through the use of detailed data and flood risk/vulnerability maps, and the ``event management with real-time monitoring/forecast of the events through the collection of observed data from real sensors, estimated/forecasted data from hydrologic models as well as qualitative data collected through a crowdsourcing app.",WEB-BASED PLATFORM; EARLY WARNING SYSTEM; VULNERABILITY SIMULATIONS; FLOOD RISK MAPS; RAINFALL ESTIMATES; MICROWAVE LINKS; CML; CROWDSOURCING; SENSIBLE TARGETS,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"VILLANI, G (REPRINT AUTHOR), ARPAE SIMC REG AGCY PREVENT ENVIRONM \& ENERGY EMI, HYDROMETEOCLIMATE SERV, I-40122 BOLOGNA, ITALY.;VILLANI, GIULIA, TOMEI, FAUSTO, AGNETTI, ALBERTO, LEONI, PAOLO, BOTARELLI, LUCIO, ARPAE SIMC REG AGCY PREVENT ENVIRONM \& ENERGY EMI, HYDROMETEOCLIMATE SERV, I-40122 BOLOGNA, ITALY.;NANNI, STEFANIA, MAZZINI, GIANLUCA, LEPIDASCPA, RES \& PROTOTYPE AREA, I-40128 BOLOGNA, ITALY.;PASETTI, STEFANIA, FOLEGANI, MARCO, MEEO SRL, I-44123 FERRARA, ITALY.;MANGIARACINA, RITA, NIER INGN SPA, I-40013 BOLOGNA, ITALY.;CASTELLARI, SERGIO, EEA, DK-1050 COPENHAGEN, DENMARK.;CASTELLARI, SERGIO, INGV, SEZ BOLOGNA, I-40128 BOLOGNA, ITALY.",10.3390/CLI7120145,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,EUROPEAN UNION'S LIFE PROGRAMME [LIFE15/CCA/IT/00035],,,12,,MDPI,7,2019,ISI000505556200009,34,METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES,0,METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES,GVILLANIARPAE.IT STEFANIA.NANNILEPIDA.IT FTOMEIARPAE.IT PASETTIMEEO.IT R.MANGIARACINANIERING.IT AAGNETTIARPAE.IT PLEONIARPAE.IT FOLEGANIMEEO.IT G.MAZZINIIEEE.ORG LBOTARELLIARPAE.IT SERGIO.CASTELLARIEEA.EUROPA.EU,,KA1JX,,"VILLANI, G (REPRINT AUTHOR), ARPAE SIMC REG AGCY PREVENT ENVIRONM \& ENERGY EMI, HYDROMETEOCLIMATE SERV, I-40122 BOLOGNA, ITALY",ISI,HYDROMETEOCLIMATE SERV;RES AND PROTOTYPE AREA,HYDROMETEOCLIMATE SERV,,"VILLANI G, 2019, CLIMATE","VILLANI G, 2019, CLIMATE",FALSE,1,6,1,1,0,0,1_3_4_7,1,2
264,Estupina Vb;Raynaud F;Bourgeois N;Kong-A-Siou L;Collet L;Haziza E;Servat E,Operational tools to help stakeholders to protect and alert municipalities facing uncertainties and changes in karst flash floods,CHANGES IN FLOOD RISK AND PERCEPTION IN CATCHMENTS AND CITIES,"Flash floods are often responsible for many deaths and involve many material damages. Regarding mediterranean karst aquifers, the complexity of connections, between surface and groundwater, as well as weather non-stationarity patterns, increase difficulties in understanding the basins behaviour and thus warning and protecting people. Furthermore, given the recent changes in land use and extreme rainfall events, knowledge of the past floods is no longer sufficient to manage flood risks. Therefore the worst realistic flood that could occur should be considered. Physical and processes-based hydrological models are considered among the best ways to forecast floods under diverse conditions. However, they rarely match with the stakeholders' needs. In fact, the forecasting services, the municipalities, and the civil security have difficulties in running and interpreting data-consuming models in real-time, above all if data are uncertain or non-existent. To face these social and technical difficulties and help stakeholders, this study develops two operational tools derived from these models. These tools aim at planning real-time decisions given little, changing, and uncertain information available, which are: (i) a hydrological graphical tool (abacus) to estimate flood peak discharge from the karst past state and the forecasted but uncertain intense rainfall, (ii) a gis-based method (mare) to estimate the potential flooded pathways and areas, accounting for runoff and karst contributions and considering land use changes. Then, outputs of these tools are confronted to past and recent floods and municipalities observations, and the impacts of uncertainties and changes on planning decisions are discussed. The use of these tools on the recent 2014 events demonstrated their reliability and interest for stakeholders. This study was realized on french mediterranean basins, in close collaboration with the flood forecasting services (spc med-ouest, schapi, municipalities).",,DATA ASSIMILATION; RAINFALL; MODEL,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,"BAILLY-COMTE V, 2012, WATER RESOUR RES, V48, DOI 10.1029/2010WR010072.;BORRELL-ESTUPINA V, 2014, IAHS-AISH P, V363, P288.;BRED P, 2011, RAPPORT TECHNIQUE PR, P76.;COUSTAU M, 2013, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V13, P583, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-13-583-2013.;COUSTAU M, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P1119, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-1119-2012.;ESTUPINA BORRELL V., 2004, THESIS, P253.;FLEURY P, 2015, FLOOD 1.;HARADER E, 2012, HYDROL EARTH SYST SC, V16, P4247, DOI 10.5194/HESS-16-4247-2012.;HARADER E., 2015, THESIS, P1998.;KYSELY J, 2012, GLOBAL PLANET CHANGE, V98-99, P63, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOPLACHA.2012.06.010.;MACARY F, 2014, ECOL INDIC, V36, P624, DOI 10.1016/J.ECOLIND.2013.09.001.;OBLED C, 1994, J HYDROL, V159, P305, DOI 10.1016/0022-1694(94)90263-1.;TRAMBLAY Y, 2014, J HYDROL, V519, P549, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2014.07.052.;TRAMBLAY Y, 2010, J HYDROL, V387, P176, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2010.04.006.;VERRO R, 2002, ENVIRON SCI TECHNOL, V36, P1532, DOI 10.1021/ES010089O.","ESTUPINA, VB (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV MONTPELLIER, HYDROSCI MONTPELLIER UMR5569, 2 PL EUGENE BATAILLON, F-34095 MONTPELLIER 5, FRANCE.;ESTUPINA, V.

156,Nogueira De Andrade Mm;Szlafsztein Cf,Community participation in flood mapping in the amazon through interdisciplinary methods,NATURAL HAZARDS,"Community participation is an increasing issue in risk and disaster management. This paper argues that interdisciplinary methods are necessary for mapping flooding areas. On the one hand, hazards can be quantified and mapped through deductive approaches and methods from the natural sciences. On the other hand, hazards can also be described from the population perspective at a local level using social sciences methods. The methods are successfully mixed with a geographical information system environment. In the first case, important inputs include topographic and slope data for geomorphological mapping. In the second case, timeline methodology can indicate temporally the most severe floods, and a participatory map construction gives the population the opportunity to point out the affected areas. These methods were applied in a case study in the lower amazon river region in the urban area of the santar,m municipality. High-resolution images and remote sensing were essential tools. Results show that nine neighborhoods have high and moderate susceptibility areas to riverine floods. Another nine neighborhoods are affected by flash floods.

131,Nogueira De Andrade Mm;Szlafsztein Cf,Vulnerability assessment including tangible and intangible components in the index composition: an amazon case study of flooding and flash flooding,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"The vulnerability of cities and communities in the amazon to flooding and flash flooding is increasing. The effects of extreme events on populations vary across landscapes, causing vulnerability to differ spatially. Traditional vulnerability studies in brazil and across the world have used the vulnerability index for the country and, more recently, municipality scales. The vulnerability dimensions are exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. For each of these dimensions, there is a group of indicators that constitutes a vulnerability index using quantitative data. Several vulnerability assessments have used sensitivity and exposure analyses and, recently, adaptive capacity has been considered. The geographical information systems (gis) analysis allows spatial regional modeling using quantitative vulnerability indicators. This paper presents a local-scale vulnerability assessment in an urban amazonian area, santarem city, using interdisciplinary methods. Data for exposure and sensitivity were gathered by remote sensing and census data, respectively. However, adaptive capacity refers to local capacities, whether infrastructural or not, and the latter were gathered by qualitative participatory methods. For the mixed data used to study adaptive capacity, we consider tangible components for countable infrastructure that can cope with hazards, and intangible components that reflect social activities based on risk perceptions and collective action. The results indicate that over 80\% of the area is highly or moderately vulnerable to flooding and flash flooding. Exposure and adaptive capacity were determinants of the results. Lower values of adaptive capacity play a significant role in vulnerability enhancement. (C) 2018 elsevier b.v.

570,Dahri N;Abida H,"Causes and impacts of flash floods: case of gabes city, southern tunisia",ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES,"Flash floods are among the most severe natural hazards that cause disastrous environmental and human impacts. The city of gabes (southern tunisia) is prone to harmful flooding, because of its location on a low plane and its extremely erratic rainfall distribution. Flood risk associated with this is expected to increase further in the coming years due to the high rate of urbanization and an ever growing population. A particular interest is given to a major flooding event, which is the single event that hit the region in the summer season over the last century. Statistical tools, satellite images treatment and analysis, meteorological observation data, geographic information system (gis), and survey data were considered in order to understand and explore the different causes of this disaster, its extent and its consequences. Era5 is a new global reanalysis tool which was used in this study to evaluate spatial and temporal extent of the examined major rainfall event. A survey was also conducted with 108 participants from different areas of the city. This latter revealed a variety of causes which amplified the flood disaster. The results obtained showed that the flood risk depends not only on rainfall intensity and the event total duration but also on land use, urban development, oasis destruction, and other anthropogenic settings. In this study, procedures are developed to classify and rank the causes and the impacts from the least to the most severe, with special attention to certain problematic spots in the city that were analyzed in detail. Flooding extent areas were estimated and were shown to be in good agreement with the observation data. Recommendations and scenarios to mitigate flood risk are also provided.",FLASH FLOOD; SURVEY; STATISTICAL ANALYSIS; CAUSES; DAMAGES; GIS,EXTREME; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; VARIABILITY; RAINFALL; REGIONS; EVENTS; TRENDS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"DAHRI, N (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV SFAX, FAC SCI, RES LAB GEOMODEL, BP 1171, SFAX 3000, TUNISIA.;DAHRI, NOURA, ABIDA, HABIB, UNIV SFAX, FAC SCI, RES LAB GEOMODEL, BP 1171, SFAX 3000, TUNISIA.",10.1007/S12517-020-5149-7,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",,TUNISIAN MINISTRY OF AGRICULTURE AND WATER RESOURCES,,1866-7511,4,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,13,2020,ISI000513500000002,50,GEOLOGY,5,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY",DAHRI.NOURAGMAIL.COM HABIB.ABIDAFSS.USF.TN,,KL5ZB,,"DAHRI, N (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV SFAX, FAC SCI, RES LAB GEOMODEL, BP 1171, SFAX 3000, TUNISIA",ISI,UNIV SFAX,UNIV SFAX,,"DAHRI N, 2020, ARAB J GEOSCI","DAHRI N, 2020, ARAB J GEOSCI",FALSE,0,3,1,0,0,0,1_3_6_11,1,2

The extreme rainfall together with bursting of moraine-dammed chorabari lake caused devastating flooding of the mandakini river and its tributaries in the garhwal himalaya. Several downstream settlements such as kedarnath (3546 m a.s.l.), rambara (2740 m a.s.l.) And gaurikund (1990 m a.s.l.) Were damaged due to flash floods. The present study was taken up to assess the extent of devastation in the mandakini valley from kedarnath to sonprayag based on ground observations, repeated ground photography, discussion with local residents (eye witnesses) and analysis of pre-event and post-event high-resolution satellite data. Overall 137 `flash flood-induced debris flow' events were mapped in the mandakini valley between kedarnath and sonprayag which led to the catastrophe and miseries to the pilgrims. The area of `flash flood-induced debris flow' and the main channel of mandakini river were increased by similar to 575 and similar to 406 \%, respectively, during the 16-17 june 2013 event. About 50 \% (7 km) of the pedestrian route (14 km) between gaurikund and kedarnath was completely washed away which obstructed the rescue operations to evacuate pilgrims, tourists and local people after the 16-17 june 2013 event. The `flash flood-induced debris flow' and moraine-dammed lake outburst events together washed away similar to 120 and similar to 90 buildings around kedarnath shrine and in rambara town, respectively, although the main kedarnath temple survived with minor damage. The database of flash flood-induced debris flows and flood effected area generated in the present research will facilitate to other disciplines (e.g., future settlements planning) for long-term reconstruction work in the affected areas of the mandakini valley.

114,Papagiannaki K;Kotroni V;Lagouvardos K;Ruin I;Bezes A,"Urban area response to flash flood-triggering rainfall, featuring human behavioral factors: the case of 22 october 2015 in attica, greece",WEATHER CLIMATE AND SOCIETY,"Over the past several decades, flash floods that occurred in attica, greece, caused serious property and infrastructure damages, disruptions in economic and social activities, and human fatalities. This paper investigated the link between rainfall and flash flood impact during the catastrophic event that affected attica on 22 october 2015, while also addressing human risk perception and behavior as a response to flash floods. The methodology included the analysis of the space-time correlation of rainfall with the citizens' calls to the emergency fire services for help, and the statistical analysis of people's responses to an online behavioral survey. The results designated critical rainfall thresholds associated with flash flood impact in the four most affected subareas of the attica region. The impact magnitude was found to be associated with the localized accumulated rainfall. Vulnerability factors, namely, population density, geographical, and environmental features, may have contributed to the differences in the impact magnitudes between the examined subareas. The analysis of the survey's behavioral responses provided insights into peoples' risk perception and coping responses relative to the space-time distribution of rainfall. The findings of this study were in agreement with the hypothesis that the more severe the rainfall, the higher peoples' severity assessment and the intensity of emotional response.

109,Mahmood S;Khan Ah;Mayo Sm,Exploring underlying causes and assessing damages of 2010 flash flood in the upper zone of panjkora river,NATURAL HAZARDS,"The paper assesses the damage caused by 2010 flash flood and its underlying causes in the upper zone of panjkora river within district dir upper, khyber pakhtunkhwa (kp) province in pakistan. Floods in general and flash floods in particular are very common in the area, and the phenomenon has intensified in the wake of observed climatic changes in the region. Anticipating an increase in the multiplicity of causes and a rise in the human, livelihood, and property losses attributed to flash floods calls for a detailed study of affected communities in the region. Within the study area of district dir upper-within the band of 200 m on both sides of panjkora river, three most affected communities, namely barikot, kalkot, and sharingal, were picked on random basis to have detailed analysis of underlying causes and the quantification of damage assessment in the area. Questionnaire-based household survey and structured interviews were conducted to investigate physical and economic damages in the sample sites. Global positioning system (gps) survey is also conducted to acquire absolute location of damages, and geographic information system is used to visualize land use, land cover, physical features, and gps data. Monsoon winds interacted with the westerlies abnormally caused unprecedented high intensity rainfall in the valley. The steep topography of the area caused rainwater to accumulate rapidly in the panjkora river channel, overpowering the withholding capacity of the river. The flash flood inflected heavy losses to life and properties of the local population. The infrastructure such as houses, roads, retaining walls, bridges, water supply schemes, and irrigation channels were destroyed severely in the whole area particularly in kalkot. Three explored underlying causes of flash floods and the degree of damage due to 2010 flash floods in the region call for an enhanced realization for climatic change adaptability, flood risk management, and mitigation measures, better flood response through early warning systems, and improved rehabilitation and recovery efforts within flood prone areas such as district dir upper, kp, pakistan.",FLASH FLOOD; UNDERLYING CAUSES; GIS; GPS; DAMAGES,RISK-MANAGEMENT; IMPACT; VULNERABILITY; PAKISTAN; SYSTEM; SCALE; BASIN,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,9,"AHMAD I, 2015, ADV METEOROL, DOI 10.1155/2015/431860.;ALDERMAN K, 2012, ENVIRON INT, V47, P37, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVINT.2012.06.003.;ASGHARPOUR SE, 2011, PROCD SOC BEHV, V19, P556, DOI 10.1016/J.SBSPRO.2011.05.169.;ATTA-UR R, 2011, NAT HAZARDS, V59, P1239, DOI DOI 10.1007/S11069-0011-9830-8.;ATTA-UR-RAHMAN, 2013, NAT HAZARDS, V66, P887, DOI 10.1007/S11069-012-0528-3.;BENISTON M., 2011, IMPACT CLIMATE CHANG.;BORGA M, 2011, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V14, P834, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2011.05.017.;BORGA M, 2007, J HYDROMETEOROL, V8, P1049, DOI 10.1175/JHM593.1.;CHAMPION S.

85,Mahmood Mi;Elagib Na;Horn F;Saad Sag,Lessons learned from khartoum flash flood impacts: an integrated assessment,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"This study aims at enabling the compilation of key lessons for decision makers and urban planners in rapidly urbanizing cities regarding the identification of representative, chief causal natural and human factors for the increased level of flash flood risk. To achieve this, the impacts of flash flood events of 2013 and 2014 in the capital of sudan, khartoum, were assessed using seven integrated approaches, i.e. Rainfall data analysis, document analysis of affected people and houses, observational fieldwork in the worst flood affected areas, people's perception of causes and mitigation measures through household interviews, reported drinking water quality, reported water-related diseases and social risk assessment. Several lessons have been developed as follows. Urban planners must recognize the devastating risks of building within natural pathways of ephemeral watercourses. They must also ensure effective drainage infrastructures and physio-geographical investigations prior to developing urban areas. The existing urban drainage systems become ineffective due to blockage by urban waste. Building of unauthorized drainage and embankment structures by locals often cause greater flood problems than normal. The urban runoff is especially problematic for residential areas built within low-lying areas having naturally low infiltration capacity, as surface water can rapidly collect within hollows and depressions, or beside elevated roads that preclude the free flow of floodwater. Weak housing and infrastructure quality are especially vulnerable to flash flooding and even to rainfall directly. Establishment of services infrastructure is imperative for flash flood disaster risk reduction. Water supply should be from lower aquifers to avoid contaminant ground water. Regular monitoring of water quality and archiving of its indicators help identify water-related diseases and sources of water contamination in the event of environmental disasters such as floods. Though the understanding of risk perception by the locals is an important aspect of the decision making and planning processes, it should be advanced enough for proper awareness.

155,Chow Wtl;Cheong Bd;Ho Bh,A multimethod approach towards assessing urban flood patterns and its associated vulnerabilities in singapore,ADVANCES IN METEOROLOGY,"We investigated flooding patterns in the urbanised city-state of singapore through a multimethod approach combining station precipitation data with archival newspaper and governmental records, changes in flash floods frequencies or reported impacts of floods towards singapore society were documented. We subsequently discussed potential flooding impacts in the context of urban vulnerability, based on future urbanisation and forecasted precipitation projections for singapore. We find that, despite effective flood management, (i) significant increases in reported flash flood frequency occurred in contemporary (post-2000) relative to preceding (1984-1999) periods, (ii) these flash floods coincide with more localised, ``patchy storm events, (iii) storms in recent years are also more intense and frequent, and (iv) floods result in low human casualties but have high economic costs via insurance damage claims. We assess that singapore presently has low vulnerability to floods vis-a-vis other regional cities largely due to holistic flood management via consistent and successful infrastructural development, widespread flood monitoring, and effective advisory platforms. We conclude, however, that future vulnerabilities may increase from stresses arising from physical exposure to climate change and from demographic sensitivity via rapid population growth. Anticipating these changes is potentially useful in maintaining the high resilience of singapore towards this hydrometeorological hazard.",,HEAT-ISLAND; FREQUENCY; THWAITES; EVENTS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,6,"BECK F, 2015, J HYDROL-REG STUD, V3, P337, DOI 10.1016/J.EJRH.2015.02.001.;BRUN S.

51,Wilhelmi Ov;Morss Re,Integrated analysis of societal vulnerability in an extreme precipitation event: a fort collins case study,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY,"Floods, droughts, heat waves, and storms have always been part of human lives because they are a normal part of climate variability. However, the observed trends and projected changes in global climate have the potential to alter patterns of these climatic hazards and extreme weather events. Extreme precipitation is one of the factors that contribute to flash floods, but it is the characteristics of the environment, individuals, and society that can turn these natural phenomena into life-threatening disasters. Past decades of disaster risk research and assessments have lead to many innovative approaches to integrating data across disciplinary domains. Recent advancements in integration of meteorological information with other environmental and social data, using geographic information systems (gis), allow for integrated spatial assessments of societal vulnerability to weather-related hazards. A case study presented in this article builds on the substantial body of previous and ongoing research that is focused on developing improved methods for characterizing and quantifying vulnerabilities to weather hazards, in general, and extreme precipitation events, in particular. Integrating social science into meteorological research and practice has been a key interdisciplinary direction in the meteorological community. Therefore, with specific attention to integrating spatially explicit information on weather and society, this article focuses on interactions between meteorological and social characteristics of an extreme precipitation event that resulted in a flash flood disaster in fort collins, colorado. Using the data from 1997 fort collins, colorado extreme precipitation event, this study constructs a straightforward methodology for integrating meteorological data with readily available societal information into a gis-based analysis of vulnerable people and places. With the goal of developing specific, targeted interventions and flash flood preparedness and emergency response actions, the analysis of societal vulnerability presented in this paper is specifically focused on the factors affecting population's response and coping capacities to an extreme precipitation event. Challenges associated with data limitations and integration of meteorological and societal data, with diverse units and scales, into a standardized relative vulnerability measure are discussed.

358,Grodek T;Lekach J;Schick Ap,Urbanizing alluvial fans as flood-conveying and flood-reducing systems: lessons from the october 1997 eilat flood,"HYDROLOGY-GEOMORPHOLOGY INTERFACE: RAINFALL, FLOODS, SEDIMENTATION, LAND USE","On many alluvial fans in the drier parts of the world, urban settings have replaced natural areas, which in the past had been the domain of stream channel wandering, sediment deposition, and attenuation of now energy. Due to very long intervals between flood events, little attention had been paid to these natural processes, resulting in a fallacious sense of security from destructive floods and in widespread settlement before the newcomers to the desert were faced with the flooding problem. Each stage in the urban development and in the establishment of the infrastructure produced an irreversible situation, without leaving the necessary expanse required for the passage of floods and their sediments. Optimal planning for flood protection became increasingly difficult. The town of eilat was established in 1949 on a series of small alluvial fans skirting the mountain front facing the gulf of eilat. Over the years the town expanded up to the mountain front, and rain events hit at varying intervals. The extremely arid climate and long floodless years ``encourage the locals to ``forget the flood damage shortly after its occurrence, leading to an overall neglect in the maintenance of drainageways which have not been active for years. The october 1997 rainstorm was the second most intense event since 1949. By then the town had doubled in area since the previous damaging storm (which occurred in 1982), and the floods could enter the town more or less directly, without any natural buffer zone. However, despite the extraordinary rainfall amounts of the october 1997 event, the combination of storm characteristics and urban setting created a situation wherein the damage to the town was minimal. The urban framework, which includes roads, streets, parking lots, playgrounds, parks etc., often without flow continuity between them, caused a divergence of the flows, attenuation of their velocity, and the capture of floodwaters in small local storages. The result was a fast deterioration in peak discharge, a longer flow duration, and little appreciable damage. The detailed analysis of the october 1997 rainstorm flood shows that a relatively minor shift in the priorities of urban design of alluvial fan developments towards a healthy balance between flood-conveying and flood-reducing systems may yield long-term benefits in the handling of moderate as well as high magnitude floods.",ALLUVIAL FANS; DESERT HYDROLOGY; DRAINAGE SYSTEMS; FLASH FLOODS; FLOOD CONTROL SYSTEMS; FLOOD MANAGEMENT; FLOOD PROTECTION; URBAN HYDROLOGY; URBAN PLANNING; URBANIZATION,SEDIMENT; ISRAEL,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,3,"ASHBEL D, 1975, 45 YEARS OBSERVATION.;ASHBEL D., 1951, REGIONAL CLIMATOLOGY.;BULL WB, 1979, QUATERNARY RES, V11, P153, DOI 10.1016/0033-5894(79)90001-2.;*EIL DRAIN SURV, 1970, EIL MUNC.","GRODEK, T (REPRINT AUTHOR), HEBREW UNIV JERUSALEM, DEPT GEOG, MT SCOPUS, IL-91905 JERUSALEM, ISRAEL.;HEBREW UNIV JERUSALEM, DEPT GEOG, IL-91905 JERUSALEM, ISRAEL.",,"INST OF HYDROLOGY, WALLINGFORD OX10 8BB, ENGLAND","HASSAN, MA AND SLAYMAKER, O AND BERKOWICZ, SM",,1-901502-16-3,0144-7815,261,229-250,INT ASSOC HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES,,2000,ISI000168875300016,17,"PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY, GEOLOGY, WATER RESOURCES",4,"GEOGRAPHY, PHYSICAL, GEOLOGY, WATER RESOURCES",,IAHS PUBLICATION,BS16D,"HYDROLOGY-GEOMORPHOLOGY INTERFACE: RAINFALL, FLOODS, SEDIMENTATION, LAND USE","GRODEK, T (REPRINT AUTHOR), HEBREW UNIV JERUSALEM, DEPT GEOG, MT SCOPUS, IL-91905 JERUSALEM, ISRAEL",ISI,HEBREW UNIV JERUSALEM,HEBREW UNIV JERUSALEM,,"GRODEK T, 2000, HYDROLOGY-GEOMORPHOLOGY INTERFACE: RAINFALL, FLOODS, SEDIMENTATION, LAND USE","GRODEK T, 2000, HYDROLOGY-GEOMORPHOLOGY INTERFACE: RAINFALL, FLOODS, SEDIMENTATION, LAND USE",FALSE,1_2,6,0,0,0,6,1_3_8_16,1,2

The aiga method leads to characterize flood hazard in real time at any point along the river network. A simplified hourly-distributed hydrologic model ingests the operational radar-based quantitative precipitation estimate grids from meteo-france at a 1-km(2) resolution to produce real-time peak discharge estimates along the river network. Every 15 minutes, these discharges are compared to reference flood quantiles, which were estimated from streamflow simulated time series (using the same model). A web interface provides in real time maps of the rivers exceeding the high flood and very high flood thresholds, as well as the associated municipalities. The automated system sends warning messages to registered users who might be impacted to help them better mitigate flood risk impacts. To better detect and anticipate flash flooding, the hydrologic model is being enhanced to ingest the meteo-france's arome-nwc high-resolution precipitation nowcasts, provided at a 1.3-km resolution for a 6-hr forecast horizon, and hourly updated. To account for the forecast uncertainties, the deterministic arome-nwc forecasts are ingested as time-lagged ensembles and combined with multiple sets of hydrological regionalized parameters. The resulting flow ensembles lead to define probabilistic flood warnings. The evaluation, carried out on 13 significant events from october 2015 to june 2017 for 750 french basins, shows significant improvements in terms of flash flood event detection and effective warning lead time, compared to warnings from the current vigicrues flash setup (without any future precipitation), and the added value of probabilistic warnings.",FLASH FLOOD; WARNING; NOWCAST; ENSEMBLE FORECAST; UNCERTAINTY,,FRENCH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"DEMARGNE, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), HYDRIS HYDROL, PARC SCI AGROPOLIS 2,2196 BLVD LIRONDE, MONTFERRIER SUR LEZ, FRANCE.;DEMARGNE, JULIE, ORGANDE, DIDIER, HYDRIS HYDROL, PARC SCI AGROPOLIS 2,2196 BLVD LIRONDE, MONTFERRIER SUR LEZ, FRANCE.;JAVELLE, PIERRE, IRSTEA, UNITE RECH RECOVER, 3275 ROUTE CEZANNE, AIX EN PROVENCE, FRANCE.;GARANDEAU, LEA, JANET, BRUNO, SCHAPI, POLE MODELISAT, 42 AVE GASPARD CORIOLIS, TOULOUSE, FRANCE.",10.1051/LHB/2019023,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",,,,0018-6368,34,13-21,EDP SCIENCES S A,,2019,ISI000502591200002,19,WATER RESOURCES,1,WATER RESOURCES,JULIE.DEMARGNEHYDRIS-HYDROLOGIE.FR,,JV8DX,,"DEMARGNE, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), HYDRIS HYDROL, PARC SCI AGROPOLIS 2,2196 BLVD LIRONDE, MONTFERRIER SUR LEZ, FRANCE",ISI,SCHAPI,NOTDECLARED,,"DEMARGNE J, 2019, HOUILLE BLANCHE-REV INT","DEMARGNE J, 2019, HOUILLE BLANCHE-REV INT",TRUE,0,0,0,1_2,0,0,1_4,0,1
159,Xia J;Falconer Ra;Lin B;Tan G,Modelling flash flood risk in urban areas,PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF CIVIL ENGINEERS-WATER MANAGEMENT,"In urban areas, the impacts of flash floods can be very severe as these regions are generally densely populated and contain vital infrastructure. Parts of the uk have been particularly prone to serious urban flooding in recent years, such as boscastle in 2004. Due to climate change, the occurrence of urban flooding is predicted to increase in the future, which is likely to lead to increasing flood risk to people and property in urban areas. It is therefore appropriate to estimate potential flood risk to people and property for improved flood risk management. This paper outlines an integrated numerical model for estimating flood risk in urban areas. The model includes a module for predicting the two-dimensional hydrodynamic characteristics of urban floods and a new module for predicting the flood risk to people (both children and adults) and property (including vehicles and buildings). The hydrodynamic module of this model was verified against laboratory experimental data and real flood tracks in urban areas. The integrated model was also applied to predict the flood risk to people and property for the boscastle 2004 floods, with different recurrence frequencies. The developed integrated model can be used to predict the potential flood risk to people and property in urban areas and such predictions can be used as a rough assessment in improving flood risk management.",FLOODS \& FLOODWORKS; HYDRAULICS \& HYDRODYNAMICS; RISK \& PROBABILITY ANALYSIS,NUMERICAL-MODEL; HUMAN STABILITY; HAZARD; FLOWS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,8,"ABDERREZZAK KE, 2009, NAT HAZARDS, V50, P433, DOI 10.1007/S11069-008-9300-0.;ABT SR, 1989, WATER RESOUR BULL, V25, P881.;*ACER, 1988, DOWNSTR HAZ CLASS GU, V11, P1.","XIA, JQ (REPRINT AUTHOR), WUHAN UNIV, STATE KEY LAB WATER RESOURCES \& HYDROPOWER ENGN S, WUHAN 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA.;XIA, JUNQIANG, TAN, GUANGMING, WUHAN UNIV, STATE KEY LAB WATER RESOURCES \& HYDROPOWER ENGN S, WUHAN 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA.;FALCONER, ROGER A., LIN, BINLIANG, CARDIFF UNIV, SCH ENGN, HYDROENVIRONM RES CTR, CARDIFF, S GLAM, WALES.",10.1680/WAMA.2011.164.6.267,"INST CIVIL ENGINEERS, 1 GREAT GEORGE ST, WESTMINISTER SW 1P 3AA, ENGLAND",,"UK ENGINEERING AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCILENGINEERING \& PHYSICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL (EPSRC) [GR/S76304]; CHINESE MINISTRY OF EDUCATIONMINISTRY OF EDUCATION, CHINA [NCET-10-0619]; NATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINANATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINA [2007CB714102/6]; NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [50739003]",,1741-7589,6,267-282,ICE PUBLISHING,164,2011,ISI000291606400002,31,"ENGINEERING, WATER RESOURCES",52,"ENGINEERING, CIVIL, WATER RESOURCES",,,777HL,,"XIA, JQ (REPRINT AUTHOR), WUHAN UNIV, STATE KEY LAB WATER RESOURCES \& HYDROPOWER ENGN S, WUHAN 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,WUHAN UNIV;CARDIFF UNIV,WUHAN UNIV,,"XIA J, 2011, PROC INST CIVIL ENG -WATER MANAG","XIA J, 2011, PROC INST CIVIL ENG -WATER MANAG",FALSE,2,0,1,0,0,0,1_4,1,1

Flood events in the mediterranean region between 1990 and 2006 caused over 4,500 fatalities and cost over (sic)29 billion in damage, with italy one of the worst affected countries. The distributed computing infrastructure for hydro-meteorology (drihm) project is a european initiative aiming at providing an open, fully integrated escience environment for predicting, managing, and mitigating the risks related to such extreme weather phenomena. Incorporating both modeled and observational data sources, it enables seamless access to a set of computing resources with the objective of providing a collection of services for performing experiments with numerical models in meteorology, hydrology, and hydraulics. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how this flexible modeling architecture has been constructed using a set of standards including the netcdf and waterml2 file formats, in-memory coupling with openmi, controlled vocabularies such as cf standard names, iso19139 metadata, and a model map (metadata, adaptors, portability) gateway concept for preparing numerical models for standardized use. Hydraulic results, including the impact to buildings and hazards to people, are given for the use cases of the severe and fatal flash floods, which occurred in genoa, italy in november 2011 and october 2014.",COMPUTATIONAL METHODS; FLOODING; OPENMI; WATERML2; DATA MANAGEMENT,FRAMEWORK; SERVICES; CSDMS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,"ARGENT RM, 2004, ENVIRON MODELL SOFTW, V19, P219, DOI 10.1016/S1364-8152(03)00150-6.;BALASKO A, 2013, COMPUT SCI-AGH, V14, P307, DOI 10.7494/CSCI.2013.14.2.307.;BERGSTROM S., 1995, COMPUTER MODELS OF WATERSHED HYDROLOGY., P443.;CF STANDARD NAMES, 2003, CF MET NETCDF CF MET.;CSDMS BASIC MODEL INTERFACE, 2012, CSDMS BAS MOD INT VE.;CSDMS STANDARD NAMES, 2013, STAND NAM EX VERS 0.;D'AGOSTINO D., 2015, CONCURR COMP-PRACT E, DOI [10.1002/CPE.3700, DOI 10.1002/CPE.3700.].;D'AGOSTINO D, 2014, INT CONF HIGH PERFOR, P536, DOI 10.1109/SC.2014.49.;DANOVARO E., 2014, P E SCI 201 IN PRESS.;DRIHM CONSORTIUM D6. 2, 2015, REP APPL SERV DEL.;ELAG M, 2013, WATER RESOUR RES, V49, P5077, DOI 10.1002/WRCR.20401.;FIORI E, 2014, ATMOS RES, V138, P13, DOI 10.1016/J.ATMOSRES.2013.10.007.;GARROTE L, 1995, J HYDROL, V167, P279, DOI 10.1016/0022-1694(94)02592-Y.;GIANNONI F, 2000, PHYS CHEM EARTH PT B, V25, P665, DOI 10.1016/S1464-1909(00)00082-4.;GOUTAL N, 2012, RIVER FLOW 2012, VOLS 1 AND 2, P1169.;GOUTAL N, 2002, INT J NUMER METH FL, V38, P1, DOI 10.1002/FLD.201.;HARPHAM Q, 2015, ENVIRON MODELL SOFTW, V73, P260, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVSOFT.2015.08.007.;HARPHAM Q, 2015, J HYDROINFORM, V17, P260, DOI 10.2166/HYDRO.2014.061.;HARPHAM Q, 2014, J HYDROINFORM, V16, P890, DOI 10.2166/HYDRO.2013.190.;HILL C, 2004, COMPUT SCI ENG, V6, P18, DOI 10.1109/MCISE.2004.1255817.;JAMIESON S., 2012, P FLOODR 2012.;JAMIESON SR, 2012, P I CIVIL ENG-WAT M, V165, P581, DOI 10.1680/WAMA.12.00021.;JOHNSTON JM, 2011, ECOL MODEL, V222, P2471, DOI 10.1016/J.ECOLMODEL.2011.03.036.;KOZLOVSZKY M, 2014, SCIENCE GATEWAYS FOR DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING INFRASTRUCTURES: DEVELOPMENT FRAMEWORK AND EXPLOITATION BY SCIENTIFIC USER COMMUNITIES, P51, DOI 10.1007/978-3-319-11268-8\_4.;LLASAT MC, 2010, ADV GEOSCI, V23, P47, DOI DOI 10.5194/ADGEO-23-47-2010.;MESO-NH WEBSITE, 2015, MES NH MES NONHYDR M.;OGC NETCDF, 2013, OGC NETW COMM DAT FO.;OGC OPENMI 2. 0, 2014, OGC OP MOD INT OPENM.;OGC WATERML 2.0, 2012, OGC WATERML 2 0 1.;PECKHAM S.D., 2014, P 7 INT C ENV MOD SO.;PECKHAM SD, 2013, COMPUT GEOSCI-UK, V53, P154, DOI 10.1016/J.CAGEO.2012.04.019.;PECKHAM SD, 2013, COMPUT GEOSCI-UK, V53, P3, DOI 10.1016/J.CAGEO.2012.04.002.;PENNING-ROWSELL EDMUND, 2013, FLOOD COASTAL EROSIO.;RAMSBOTTOM D., 2003, FD2317 R D.;REBORA N, 2006, J HYDROMETEOROL, V7, P724, DOI 10.1175/JHM517.1.;ROELVINK J.

177,Huthoff F;Remo Jwf;Pinter N,"Improving flood preparedness using hydrodynamic levee-breach and inundation modelling: middle mississippi river, usa",JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT,"There is growing concern in the united states over the `residual' flood risk behind leveed floodplains, which is commonly assessed based on one-dimensional (1d) river flow models. These models fail to capture the complex flow dynamics that typically characterise floodplain inundation. Here, we demonstrate methodologies for mechanistically simulating a levee breach and flow into a levee district along the middle mississippi river using a hybrid 1d/two-dimensional (1d2d) flow model that combines a 1d model of the river channel with a two-dimensional (2d) overland-flow model for the leveed floodplain. This 2d modelling documents the complexity of flow over a large and topographically diverse leveed floodplain, including distribution and timing of inundation as well as the resulting public-safety threats. In relation to safety threats, three distinct flood phases can be recognised: (1) a flash flood phase, (2) a flow redistribution phase and (3) an equilibrium phase. The flash flood phase presents imminent threats to human life and safety, whereas subsequent phases determine inundation areas and depths, and therefore infrastructure damages. 2d modelling of levee-breach flooding provides input data necessary for: (1) specific local evacuation and mitigation planning in the metro east area, and (2) methodologies for analyses of residual risk facing other levee-protected floodplain areas.",DAM BREACH; FLOOD MAPPING; FLOOD PREPAREDNESS; FLOODPLAIN INUNDATION; MISSISSIPPI RIVER,RESISTANCE; PREDICTIONS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,4,"[ANONYMOUS], 2011, SOBEK TECHN REF MAN.;ARCEMENT G.J., 1989, 2339 US GEOL SURV, P2339.;ASCE, 2009, 2009 REP CARD AM INF.;ASSOCIATION OF STATE FLOODPLAIN MANAGERS [ASFPM], NAT FLOOD PROGR POL.;CHATTERJEE C, 2008, HYDROL PROCESS, V22, P4695, DOI 10.1002/HYP.7079.;CHOW V.

Especially after a couple of small-scale, yet disastrous events in 2010, preconditions, drivers, and methods for deriving flash flood related early warning products are investigated. This is to clarify the feasibility and the limits of envisaged early warning procedures for small catchments, hit by flashy heavy rain events. Early warning about potentially flash flood prone situations (i.e., with a suitable lead time with regard to required reaction-time needs of the stakeholders involved in flood risk management) needs to take into account not only hydrological, but also meteorological, as well as communication issues. Therefore, we propose a threefold methodology to identify potential benefits and limitations in a real-world warning/reaction context. First, the user demands (with respect to desired/required warning products, preparation times, etc.) Are investigated. Second, focusing on small catchments of some hundred square kilometers, two quantitative precipitation forecasts are verified. Third, considering the user needs, as well as the input parameter uncertainty (i.e., foremost emerging from an uncertain qpf), a feasible, yet robust hydrological modeling approach is proposed on the basis of pilot studies, employing deterministic, data-driven, and simple scoring methods.",,DATA ASSIMILATION,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,2,"BALDAUF M., 2011, TECHNICAL REPORT.;BLOSCHL G, 2014, HYDROL WASSERBEWIRTS, V58, P64, DOI 10.5675/HYWA\_2014,2\_1.;COLLIER C.G., 2003, INT J RIVER BASIN MA, V1, P225, DOI [10.1080/15715124.2003.9635209, DOI 10.1080/15715124.2003.9635209].;FAWCETT T, 2006, PATTERN RECOGN LETT, V27, P861, DOI 10.1016/J.PATREC.2005.10.010.;HAGAN MT, 2002, NEURAL NETWORK DESIG.;HWMO, 2014, VERW SACHS STAATSM U.;JESCHKE K., 2010, TECHNICAL REPORT.;JOLLIFFE I.

330,Douvinet J;Van De Wiel Mj;Delahaye D;Cossart E,A flash flood hazard assessment in dry valleys (northern france) by cellular automata modelling,NATURAL HAZARDS,"This paper presents an application of a cellular automaton-based run-off model (ruicells) to a series of small dry valleys in the seine-maritime department, northern france, to better assess their susceptibility to flash flood. These muddy floods shortly follow high rainfall (50-100 mm in less than 6 h) and occur in very small areas (< 20 km(2)). A surge generally rushes down through the main valley just a few minutes after rains have peaked. Previous events (n=69, in the period 1983-2005) have occasionally threatened human lives and have caused significant damage to property and infrastructure. Nonetheless, given the variation among the valleys and the infrequency of events, these floods have not been numerous enough to permit a statistical analysis. Instead, we numerically simulate the possible future flash floods using ruicells, a cellular automaton model driven by a set of three deterministic hydrological rules. Simulations have been conducted for 148 basins, each subject to 16 different rainfall scenarios (2.368 simulations in total) to (1) estimate the peak flow discharges (q), the specific peak flows (q (s) ), and the lag times (t) of the flash floods and (2) detect the critical rainfall intensities that would trigger warnings and increased vigilance. Our simulations indicate that the number of basins susceptible to flash flooding greatly increases with the higher rainfall intensity, the distribution of sensitive crops (sugar beet, corn, maize, and flax) and the basin morphology. Several small basins could also induce by convergence a bigger flood in the downstream humid valleys. The location of the highest simulated discharges is aligned with observed events, and this comparison provides an evaluation of the modelling performance and of the credibility of the results.",FLASH

347,Javelle P;Organde D;Demargne J;Saint-Martin C;De Saint-Aubin C;Garandeau L;Janet B,Setting up a french national flash flood warning system for ungauged catchments based on the aiga method,3RD EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT (FLOODRISK 2016),"Occurring at small temporal and spatial scales, flash floods (ff) can cause severe economic damages and human losses. To better anticipate such events and mitigate their impacts, the french ministry in charge of ecology has decided to set up a national ff warning system over the french territory. This automated system will be run by the schapi, the french national service in charge of flood forecasting, providing warnings for fast-responding ungauged catchments (area ranging from similar to 10 to similar to 1000 km(2)). It will therefore be complementary to the schapi's national ``vigilance system which concerns only gauged catchments. The ff warning system to be implemented in 2017 will be based on a discharge-threshold flood warning method called aiga (javelle et al. 2014). This method has been experimented in real time in the south of france in the rhytmme project (http://rhytmme.irstea.fr). It consists in comparing discharges generated by a simple conceptual hourly hydrologic model run at a 1-km(2) resolution to reference flood quantiles of different (e.g., 2-, 10- and 50-year) return periods. Therefore the system characterizes in real time the severity of ongoing events by the range of the return period estimated by aiga at any point along the river network. The hydrologic model ingests operational rainfall radar-gauge products from meteo-france and takes into account the baseflow and the initial soil humidity conditions to better estimate the basin response to rainfall inputs. To meet the requirements of the future ff warning system, the aiga method has been extended to the whole french territory (except corsica and overseas french territories). The calibration, regionalization and validation procedures of the hydrologic model were carried out using data for similar to 700 hydrometric stations from the 2002-2015 period. Performance of the warning system was evaluated with various contingency criteria (e.g., probability of detection and success rate). Furthermore, specific flood events were analysed in more details, by comparing warnings issued for exceeding different critical flood quantiles and their associated timing with field observations. The performance results show that the proposed ff warning system is useful, especially for ungauged sites. The analysis also points out the need to account for the uncertainties in the precipitation inputs and the hydrological modelling, as well as include precipitation forecasts to improve the effective warning lead time.",,SIMULATION; LOCATIONS; GUIDANCE; MODEL,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,4,"ALFIERI L, 2015, METEOROL APPL, V22, P3, DOI 10.1002/MET.1328.;ALFIERI L., 2011, ADV GEOSCI, V29, P69, DOI DOI 10.5194/ADGEO-29-69-2011.;ALFIERI L, 2012, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V21, P35, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2012.01.008.;ALFIERI L, 2012, J HYDROL, V424, P143, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2011.12.038.;BOISSIER L., 2013, MORTALITE LIEE CRUES.;BORGA M, 2014, J HYDROL, V518, P194, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2014.05.022.;BRAUD I, 2010, J HYDROL, V394, P162, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2010.03.033.;CASERI A., 2016, FLOODRISK 2016 3 EUR.;COLE SJ, 2009, ADV WATER RESOUR, V32, P1107, DOI 10.1016/J.ADVWATRES.2009.01.006.;CREUTIN JD, 2003, HYDROL PROCESS, V17, P1453, DOI 10.1002/HYP.5122.;DE SAINT-AUBIN C., 2016, FLOODRISK 2016 3 EUR.;ENVIRONMENT F.

The costs are a very important and sensitive aspect taking into account that the case study covers a poor romanian area.

493,Roy B;Islam S;Islam Gmt;Khan Mju;Bhattacharya B;Ali Mh;Khan As;Hossain Ms;Sarker Gc;Pieu Nm,Frequency analysis of flash floods for establishing new danger levels for the rivers in the northeast haor region of bangladesh,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,"A danger level at a river location is the level above which a flood may cause loss and damage to nearby lives, crops, and homesteads. Currently, in bangladesh, the danger level is designed and updated considering the riverine flood during the monsoon season (june-september). However, during the premonsoon season (march-may), flash floods, almost every year, damage crops in some parts of the northeast haor (saucer- or bowl-shaped large tectonic depression) region. Damage to boro rice, the only crop that is grown in this region, is catastrophic to the local population and threatens the food security of the country. At present, there is no warning or danger level to inform the community to save the boro crops from flash floods in that region. Hence, this study attempts to establish a flash flood danger level at 40 locations in the northeast region of bangladesh based on flood frequency analysis and elevations of the river floodplains. The homogeneity and adequacy of the data series was tested by performing the run test, lag 1 auto correlation, mann-kendall test, and mann-whitney test. After passing the data quality tests, flood frequency analysis was conducted using six widely used distributions: lognormal, lognormal type iii, pearson type iii, log-pearson type iii, and gumbel and generalized extreme value (gev) distributions. Best regional distribution was selected from the probability plot correlations coefficient (ppcc), normalized root mean square error (nrmse), and mean absolute error (mae) results. Among the candidate distributions, gev distribution was found to provide the best results. Then, the danger level was fixed on the basis of the flooding inundation scenarios of different return periods at which the stage is at or near the floodplain level. The results showed that for most of the stations, the 2.33-year flood level coincides with the existing floodplain level. For the rest of the stations, flash flood danger levels were fixed at the 5-year return period's flood level. The recommended flash flood danger levels were found much lower than the existing monsoon flood danger levels. For example, at sunamganj station, the existing flood danger level is 8.25 mpwd (public works datum) whereas the recommended flash flood danger level is only 6.41 mpwd. At some stations, the difference is too prominent, even more than 5 m, which can cause severe destruction for the boro rice cultivation during a flash flood. It is expected that flash flood danger levels estimated in this study may assist in flash flood forecasting in the northeast haor region and provide an effective warning at the time of necessity, thus minimizing the loss and damage by the flash flood to some extent.

517,Song Y;Park Y;Lee J;Park M;Song Y,Flood forecasting and warning system structures: procedure and application to a small urban stream in south korea,WATER,"The runoff from heavy rainfall reaches urban streams quickly, causing them to rise rapidly. It is therefore of great importance to provide sufficient lead time for evacuation planning and decision making. An efficient flood forecasting and warning method is crucial for ensuring adequate lead time. With this objective, this paper proposes an analysis method for a flood forecasting and warning system, and establishes the criteria for issuing urban-stream flash flood warnings based on the amount of rainfall to allow sufficient lead time. The proposed methodology is a nonstructural approach to flood prediction and risk reduction. It considers water level fluctuations during a rainfall event and estimates the upstream (alert point) and downstream (confluence) water levels for water level analysis based on the rainfall intensity and duration. We also investigate the rainfall/runoff and flow rate/water level relationships using the hydrologic engineering center's hydrologic modeling system (hec-hms) and the hec's river analysis system (hec-ras) models, respectively, and estimate the rainfall threshold for issuing flash flood warnings depending on the backwater state based on actual watershed conditions. We present a methodology for issuing flash flood warnings at a critical point by considering the effects of fluctuations in various backwater conditions in real time, which will provide practical support for decision making by disaster protection workers. The results are compared with real-time water level observations of the dorim stream. Finally, we verify the validity of the flash flood warning criteria by comparing the predicted values with the observed values and performing validity analysis.",FLASH FLOOD FORECASTING; FLOOD FORECASTING AND WARNING SYSTEM; FLOOD WARNING CRITERIA; RAINFALL; RUNOFF,GENETIC PROGRAMMING-MODEL; RUNOFF,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,none,"SONG, Y (REPRINT AUTHOR), DAEGU TECH UNIV, DEPT CIVIL ENGN \& LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURAL, DAEGU 42734, SOUTH KOREA.;SONG, YANGHO, LEE, JUNGHO, HANBAT NATL UNIV, DEPT CIVIL \& ENVIRONM ENGN, DAEJEON 34158, SOUTH KOREA.;PARK, YOONKYUNG, DEEPCLOUD CO LTD, CORP AFFILIATED RES INST, BUSAN 48058, SOUTH KOREA.;PARK, MOOJONG, HANSEO UNIV, DEPT AERONAUT \& CIVIL ENGN, SEOSAN 31962, SOUTH KOREA.;SONG, YOUNGSEOK, DAEGU TECH UNIV, DEPT CIVIL ENGN \& LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURAL, DAEGU 42734, SOUTH KOREA.",10.3390/W11081571,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,KOREA METEOROLOGICAL ADMINISTRATION RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM [2018-03010],,,8,,MDPI,11,2019,ISI000484561500045,26,WATER RESOURCES,5,WATER RESOURCES,KIND711HANMAIL.NET,,IV9CM,,"SONG, Y (REPRINT AUTHOR), DAEGU TECH UNIV, DEPT CIVIL ENGN \& LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURAL, DAEGU 42734, SOUTH KOREA",ISI,HANBAT NATL UNIV;CORP AFFILIATED RES INST;HANSEO UNIV;DAEGU TECH UNIV,DAEGU TECH UNIV,,"SONG Y, 2019, WATER","SONG Y, 2019, WATER",FALSE,1,0,0,1_2,0,0,1_4,1,4
565,Akay H;Kocyigit Mb,"Hydrologic assessment approach for river bridges in western black sea basin, turkey",JOURNAL OF PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTED FACILITIES,"In this study, a hydrologic assessment approach implemented in a safety-inspection methodology for river bridges in turkey was developed in which various hydrologic indicators such as morphometric parameters, land cover and use, precipitation magnitude and type, flood history, and presence of retention structures were selected to assess hydrologic behavior and flash-flood potential of the bridge watershed. According to the proposed approach, hydrologic grading of the watersheds was performed by summing up the grades of the indicators and classifying the bridge watershed with regard to the flash-flood susceptibility of the bridge. This hydrologic assessment approach was applied to 10 river bridges in the western black sea basin in turkey, where bridges are often affected by severe flash floods. It was found that the selected indicators encouragingly exhibited the flood potential and hydrologic behavior of the watersheds by comparing the grades of the bridges considered. So, hydrologic assessment could enable engineers to take necessary precautions against effects of flooding on river bridges both in design and operation stages.

They impact vast areas, particularly in arid/semi-arid regions, causing serious damages with thousands of human casualties and billions of euros in economic losses. This study contributes to a comprehensive evaluation of flash flooding occurrences, impacts, and possible mitigation. In this study, the dahab region in southern egypt's sinai peninsula was selected for flash flooding vulnerability assessment. Although located in an arid region, it suffers from frequent and severe flash floods. Here, a straightforward workflow was applied to simulate the impact of flash flooding and assess the vulnerability of the dahab area via consideration of a maximum storm event as a worst- case scenario. Originally, morphometric analysis was performed to determine the most hazardous sub-basins susceptible to flash flooding. The highest recorded storm event in the region was selected to calculate the maximum volume of surface runoff for the model simulation. Then, the hydrologic model and river analysis system (hec-ras) software were used to calculate the inundation level across the entire city of dahab. Despite some data limitations, this study shows clearly that the dahab area would have problems incurring from flash flooding if no mitigation measures were to be considered. Results indicate that the area of dahab is greatly vulnerable to flash flooding with approximately 72\% of the total infrastructure being negatively impacted in the worst-case scenario. The adopted approach used in this study can be applied efficiently in similar regions in the sinai peninsula or elsewhere.",GIS; FLASH FLOODS; VULNERABILITY; MORPHOMETRIC ANALYSIS; HYDROLOGICAL MODEL; HEC-RAS; DAHAB CITY; SINAI PENINSULA,INFORMATION-SYSTEM; WATER-RESOURCE; SIMULATION; MANAGEMENT; CATCHMENT; REGIONS; RUNOFF,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"OMRAN, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), SUEZ UNIV, FAC PETR \& MIN ENGN, DEPT SCI \& MATH ENGN, SUEZ, EGYPT.;OMRAN, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), TUBINGEN UNIV, HEIDELBERGER AKAD WISSENSCH, INST GEOG, TUBINGEN, GERMANY.;PRAMA, MARIA, SCHROEDER, DIETRICH, HSCH TECH STUTTGART, FAC GEOMAT COMP SCI \& MATH, DEPT PHOTOGRAMMETRY \& GEOINFORMAT, STUTTGART, GERMANY.;OMRAN, ADEL, SUEZ UNIV, FAC PETR \& MIN ENGN, DEPT SCI \& MATH ENGN, SUEZ, EGYPT.;OMRAN, ADEL, TUBINGEN UNIV, HEIDELBERGER AKAD WISSENSCH, INST GEOG, TUBINGEN, GERMANY.;ABOUELMAGD, ABDOU, SUEZ CANAL UNIV, DEPT GEOL, FAC SCI, ISMAILIA 41522, EGYPT.",10.1007/S12665-020-8860-5,"ONE NEW YORK PLAZA, SUITE 4600, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,PROJEKT DEAL; DEPARTMENT OF PHOTOGRAMMETRY AND GEOINFORMATICS IN HOCHSCHULE FUR TECHNIK STUTTGART; WATER RESOURCES RESEARCH INSTITUTE (WRRI) IN EGYPT; GEOGRAPHISCHE INSTITUTE AT UNIVERSITAT TUBINGEN; HEIDELBERGER AKADEMIE FUR WISSENSCHAFTEN,,1866-6280,5,,SPRINGER,79,2020,ISI000518576700003,74,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, GEOLOGY, WATER RESOURCES",3,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, WATER RESOURCES",MARIA.PRAMAKONSTANZ.DE ADELFOUAD.OMRANSUEZUNIV.EDU.EG DIETRICH.SCHROEDERHFT-STUTTGART.DE ABDOU\_ABOUELMAGDSCIENCE.SUEZ.EDU.EG,,KS8SA,,"OMRAN, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), SUEZ UNIV, FAC PETR \& MIN ENGN, DEPT SCI \& MATH ENGN, SUEZ, EGYPT",ISI,SCHROEDER;SUEZ UNIV;TUBINGEN UNIV;SUEZ CANAL UNIV,SUEZ UNIV,,"PRAMA M, 2020, ENVIRON EARTH SCI","PRAMA M, 2020, ENVIRON EARTH SCI",FALSE,1,0,2,0,0,6,1_4,0,1

In this study, projections of seven global circulation models (gcms) associated with high and medium-low representative concentration pathways (rcp 8.5 and rcp 4.5) for the period 2021-2040 and 2081-2100 were adopted to assess changes on runoffs in the gilgel abbay watershed, the upper blue nile basin. A weather generator was employed to generate daily temperature and precipitation to drive a hydrological model for impact assessment. Despite the projected magnitude of changes varied among different gcms and rcps, increasing runoffs in wet-season and decreasing in dry-season are observed in both periods, mainly attributed to the change in projected precipitation. Such changes are profound in cases of rcp 8.5 with respect to those of rcp 4.5 and in cases of 2081-2100 with respect to those of 2021-2040. Although the increasing runoffs would provide greater inflow to lake tana, the increase of precipitation in wet-season would imply a higher possibility of flash floods. On the other hand, decrease runoffs in dry-season further intensify existing shortage of irrigation water demand.

The prevention and mitigation of flooding can be studied on three levels: on individual properties, small communities, and whole towns or cities. The current study area is located in hurghada on the red sea, which is considered an important area for coastal tourism. The study area is located at distance 7.50 km from el gouna city along the red sea and east of hurghada-al ismaileya road. The aim of this research is to derive the runoff flow paths across the study area and their flow magnitudes under different rainfall events of 10, 25, 50, and 100 year return periods in order to design the flood mitigation measures to protect such important areas. Field data (e.g., topographic data and rainfall intensities) were collected for the study area. The results indicated that the site is exposed to high flash flood risk and protection work is required. In order to protect the area from flood risks, locations of number of drainage channels and dams were selected and designed based on flood quantity and direction. The proposed mitigation system is capable of protecting this crucial area from flood risks and increases the national income from tourism.

290,Hooke Jm;Mant J,Floodwater use and management strategies in valleys of southeast spain,LAND DEGRADATION \& DEVELOPMENT,"Southeast spain has a semiarid climate with highly variable rainfall from year to year. Global warming scenarios predict a decrease in rainfall in future and land-use changes may also alter run-off regimes. Water deficit has meant that various practices of floodwater farming have traditionally operated in valley floors. However, flash floods in the valley floors can also be dangerous and damaging. Many of the boqueras and other floodwater irrigation systems have been abandoned. The effects on the hydrological regime of the channel are calculated. These structures and water management practices could have an effect on the magnitude of low-moderate peak discharges, but are insignificant in high flows. Modem channel and flood management employs check dams, but these are frequently destroyed in moderate-high flows. Alternative strategies of channel management need to be sought and the use or vegetation cover to dissipate flood peaks and to reduce erosion may offer one possibility.

There are two types of drainage basins in sudirman street and delineated to two different catchment areas. The result of study shows that both of existing channels have enough capability to accommodate peak runoff until 5-year storm, yet the flash flood still occurs during the heavy rain. This is leading to conclusion that the existing inflow design is not effective to convey the runoff into existing drainage.

Sudden, heavy rainfall in a short time as well as the summer drought periods can be a major concern for urban water management systems. In addition to overloading the urban sewer system, urban flash floods caused by large amounts of precipitation can lead to serious damage in connection with surface runoff, furthermore, this significant amount of water is removed from the water cycle of the city without utilization (infiltration, storage). Various water management and hydrology models, such as ufore-hydro used in our analyses, can serve as suitable tools for investigating these processes. In our research, we examined the role of vegetation covered areas in urban water cycle, paying special attention to their impact on surface runoff. The results of modeling in szeged sample areas show that vegetation can considerably reduce the volume and amplitude of surface runoff.

567,Kankanamge Sl;Mendis P;Ngo T,Use of fluid structure interaction technique for flash flood impact assessment of structural components,JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT,"Prediction of the initial impact force is a major task associated with flood damage assessment of structures subjected to flash flooding especially due to dam break and levee breach. Investigation of failure modes such as overturning and sliding due to soil scouring or erosion is not relevant if the structure first fails by the massive initial dynamic impact. Therefore, a careful assessment of the initial flood impact is critical for the design of structures and during the flood damage assessment process. In most of the past flood damage studies, total flood load acting on the structures was estimated by maximum velocities and water depths obtained from the two-dimensional hydrodynamic models or the field data. The outcome of these results has shown potential uncertainty in current methods. We present a new approach to calculate the load on structural components impacted by a dam break wave, by modelling the three-dimensional free surface fluid-structure interaction (fsi) using the incompressible computational fluid dynamics (icfd) techniques. Two experimental datasets available in the literature are used to validate the results. Finally, we conclude that fsi/ifcd method can be used to accurately determine the initial impact force on structural components subjected to flash floods for flood damage assessment.",DAM BREAK; FLASH FLOOD; FLOOD DAMAGES; FLUID-STRUCTURE INTERACTION (FSI); INCOMPRESSIBLE COMPUTATIONAL FLUID DYNAMICS (ICFD),FREE-SURFACE; NUMERICAL-SIMULATION; VERTICAL WALL; WAVE IMPACT; DAMAGE; VELOCITY; FORCES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"KANKANAMGE, SL (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV MELBOURNE, DEPT INFRASTRUCT ENGN, MELBOURNE, VIC 3010, AUSTRALIA.;KANKANAMGE, SUNINDU L., MENDIS, PRIYAN, NGO, TUAN, UNIV MELBOURNE, DEPT INFRASTRUCT ENGN, MELBOURNE, VIC 3010, AUSTRALIA.",10.1111/JFR3.12581,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,,,1753-318X,1,,WILEY,13,2020,ISI000514290300001,52,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, WATER RESOURCES",0,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",LAKMALIKSTUDENT.UNIMELB.EDU.AU,,KM6ZZ,,"KANKANAMGE, SL (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV MELBOURNE, DEPT INFRASTRUCT ENGN, MELBOURNE, VIC 3010, AUSTRALIA",ISI,UNIV MELBOURNE,UNIV MELBOURNE,,"KANKANAMGE SL, 2020, J FLOOD RISK MANAG","KANKANAMGE SL, 2020, J FLOOD RISK MANAG",FALSE,2,6,0,0,0,6,1_4,0,3

Accurate risk assessment is critical to an efficient urban pluvial flood management, particularly in transportation sector. This paper describes an integrated methodology, which initially makes use of high resolution 2d inundation modeling and flood depth-dependent measure to evaluate the potential impact and risk of pluvial flash flood on road network in the city center of shanghai, china. Intensity-duration-frequency relationships of shanghai rainstorm and chicago design storm are combined to generate ensemble rainfall scenarios. A hydrodynamic model (floodmap-hydroinundation2d) is used to simulate overland flow and flood inundation for each scenario. Furthermore, road impact and risk assessment are respectively conducted by a new proposed algorithm and proxy. Results suggest that the flood response is a function of spatio-temporal distribution of precipitation and local characteristics (i.e. Drainage and topography), and pluvial flash flood is found to lead to proportionate but nonlinear impact on intra-urban road inundation risk. The approach tested here would provide more detailed flood information for smart management of urban street network and may be applied to other big cities where road flood risk is evolving in the context of climate change and urbanization.

78,Debortoli Ns;Camarinha Pim;Marengo Ja;Rodrigues Rr,An index of brazil's vulnerability to expected increases in natural flash flooding and landslide disasters in the context of climate change,NATURAL HAZARDS,"There is observational evidence that hydrometeorological extremes, such as heavy rainfall events, have become more frequent and intense in the last decades around the world. In brazil, intense rainfall events that triggered flash floods and landslides were responsible for 74\% of the deaths related to natural disasters in the 1991-2010 period. To evaluate brazil's hot spots of vulnerability to these disasters, two indices were developed using three data sets: (1) climate, with ipcc climate extreme indices, (2) environmental, including land use, drainage systems, relief, slope, road density and hydrography, and (3) socioeconomic, including the gini coefficient, human development index, housing conditions and a poverty-related index. Simulations at high resolution were carried out using the eta 20-km regional climate model nested within two global climate models: hadgem2 es and miroc 5 ipcc ar5 models. For the baseline period of 1961-1990, the vulnerability indices were adjusted by means of an iterative process and were validated by comparing them to the brazilian national disasters data. The two indices were also used to estimate the vulnerability up to the end of the twenty-first century, using the representative concentration pathways (rcp) 4.5 and 8.5 from the ipcc ar5 rcp scenarios.

In the past 10 years, urban flooding events have caused huge disaster losses in chinese cities. This has resulted in significant negative effects on the urban infrastructure, socioeconomic systems, and urban residents, thus causing widespread concern. Studies have confirmed the change in extreme rainstorms is due to the changing environments in many cities globally conducting studies on the impact of these rainstorms with different characteristics for urban flooding is valuable for coping with unfavorable situations in addition, numerical simulations provide an economical and viable means to perform these studies. This paper presents a numerical model of xiamen island in china. Simulations were conducted for 12 design rainstorm events with different return periods, rain patterns, and durations. The results indicate that, in the case of an equal rainfall amount, the rainfall intensity is the key factor that affects the inundated area, depth, and damages. However, the rainfall intensity is not the only determining factor, the rainfall pattern also affects the inundations. In regard to the rainfall pattern, a higher rainfall peak coefficient usually leads to severe urban inundation and damage. As a result, the lag time would be shorter, which may further exacerbate the impact of urban flood disasters.

31,Karamouz M;Hosseinpour A;Nazif S,Improvement of urban drainage system performance under climate change impact: case study,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,"Urban floods have adverse impacts on the performance of urban infrastructures and the life of residents. The floods cause heavy damages and perturbation in the serviceability of urban infrastructures as well as transportation. Therefore, different factors affecting the urban water flood characteristics should be considered in urban development planning, especially in metropolitan areas. In recent years, climate change and its consequences have affected the total components of the water cycle as well as floods. These effects are intensified in urban areas because of the anthropogenic effects they have on the water cycle, such as reducing the infiltration capacity of basins, construction regardless of the channel's right of way, and disposal of sediment and solid wastes into channels that will decrease the channels' safe carrying capacity. In this way, incorporating climate change impact on urban water studies could help to achieve more reliable results to be applied in real-time planning of urban areas through selection of best management practices (bmps). In this study, an algorithm for selecting the bmps to improve the system performance and reliability in dealing with urban flash floods is proposed that considers the anthropogenic and climate change effects. The suggested algorithm is applied to the tehran metropolitan area drainage system as a case study. First, the future rainfall pattern of the study area under climate change impact is simulated. Then, the effectiveness of present and future development projects for improvement of drainage system performance is evaluated under different scenarios. Also, the effect of solid wastes and sediments carried with surface runoff in system performance is considered. Finally, feasibility of suggested bmps and their effectiveness in urban flood management as well as their related costs and benefits are considered. The results of the study show the significance of using analytical and management tools in assessing and improving the urban drainage system. Doi: 10.1061/(asce)he.1943-5584.0000317.

The goal of this study is to determine the feasibility of using distributed lid controls within an urbanized watershed for flood mitigation. The rocky branch watershed in columbia, south carolina, is an excellent case study because it experiences flash floods almost annually and has limited space for traditional, centralized stormwater controls to mitigate these floods. The storm water management model (swmm) was used to model flooding with rain gardens as the lid approach for flood mitigation owing to their storage potential. The results of the study suggest that rain gardens with 30-cm berm heights and a total area equal to 20\% of the impervious surfaces within the watershed should provide sufficient storage to mitigate flooding for rain events up to and including a 10-year storm event. Once sufficient storage is available, the challenge is diverting runoff generated from impervious surfaces into rain gardens. The results of this study suggest approximately 15, 27, and 38\% of the runoff generated from impervious surfaces should be diverted to rain gardens to mitigate flooding from 2-, 5-, and 10-year storm events, respectively. Given prior work on the adoption of lid approaches for other watersheds, rain gardens could be effective at mitigating up to a 5-year storm event within the watershed, although further research on possible adoption rates in the study watershed is needed to more fully support this conclusion.",STORMWATER MANAGEMENT; URBAN HYDROLOGY; URBAN FLOODING; STORM WATER MANAGEMENT MODEL (SWMM); LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID),LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT; MANAGEMENT-PRACTICES; CATCHMENT-SCALE; MODELS; COVER,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,6,"AAD MPA, 2010, J HYDROL ENG, V15, P434, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0000136.;ARNOLD CL, 1996, J AM PLANN ASSOC, V62, P243, DOI 10.1080/01944369608975688.;ATCHISON D., 2006, DESIGN GUIDELINES ST.;BAKACS M.

548,Pla G;Crippa J;Djerboua A;Dobricean O;Dongar F;Eugene A;Raymond M,Espada: a fully modernized system for real time management of urban flash floods under current modernization,HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU,"The city of nimes is exposed to flood risks (especially to flash floods). No major river flows in the dense urban area of the city. Instead, dry canals called ``cadereaux cross the city and are used to collect water runoff. The mediterranean rains, the small catchment basins (size under 30 km(2)) and the karstic type as well as the piedmont situation are factors bringing about significant runoff with major overflow and flash floods. After the floods that took place on the 3rd of october 1988, the city of nimes launched a new ambitious policy aiming at preventing flooding risks, including important works on the ``cadereaux. In 2004, as part of this process, the city implemented an alert system espada (evaluation et suivi des precipitations en agglomeration pour devancer l'alerte). The goal of this system is to forecast the ``cadereaux flow rates up to 1 h 30 ahead, by using a hydrological model with sharp representation of the karstic ecosystem. In 2014, within the framework of the programs of actions for inundations prevention, the city of nimes initiated the modernization of the espada system to improve the quality of the input data in real time (5-min time step). A radio network dedicated to the collection of the data (through the city's hydrometeorological sensors) was put in place, thus offering a secure and efficient data collection. The radio network also enables real-time data collection from the spc-gd (service de prevision des crues du grand delta, regional office in charge of flood prevention) stations. Furthermore, the city developed a high resolution spatial radar which enables rain measurement and forecasting. By using 500 m pixels waves, this tool can identify local intensities on the small drainage basins. Data calibration is made with rain gauges which are available. As part of the second step of modernization, the forecasting model is now being improved in order to work continuously with 5-min time step. The propagation is managed by 1d hydraulic model. In addition, the linmnigraphic data are used in real time to update the flow rates values and the storage levels of the basins. Similarly, a web interface is currently under development, allowing crisis-management key-players to efficiently use the risk mitigation tools. Over time, the general public will have access to some of the espada system, using an interface similar to the vigicrues portal.",FLASH FLOODS; REALTIME FORECASTING; MONITORING; RAINFALL IMAGERY; NIMES,,FRENCH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"DOBRICEAN, O (REPRINT AUTHOR), SYNAPSE, 140 RUE CLEMENT FRANCOIS PRUNELLE, F-34790 GRABELS, FRANCE.;PLA, GUILLAUME, CRIPPA, JULIEN, VILLE NIMES, 152 AVE ROBERT BOMPARD, F-30033 NIMES 9, FRANCE.;DJERBOUA, ABDELATIF, KISTERS RHEA, 147 AVE PAUL DOUMER, F-92500 RUEIL MALMAISON, FRANCE.;DOBRICEAN, OCTAVIAN, DONGAR, FREDERIC, SYNAPSE, 140 RUE CLEMENT FRANCOIS PRUNELLE, F-34790 GRABELS, FRANCE.;EUGENE, ALLAN, RAYMOND, MIREILLE, EGIS EAU, 889 RUE VIEILLE POSTE, F-34000 MONTPELLIER, FRANCE.",10.1051/LHB/2019027,"17, AVE DU HOGGAR, PA COURTABOEUF, BP 112, F-91944 LES ULIS CEDEX A, FRANCE",,,,0018-6368,34,57-66,EDP SCIENCES S A,,2019,ISI000502591200007,15,WATER RESOURCES,5,WATER RESOURCES,OCTAVIAN.DOBRICEANSYNAPSE-INFO.COM,,JV8DX,,"DOBRICEAN, O (REPRINT AUTHOR), SYNAPSE, 140 RUE CLEMENT FRANCOIS PRUNELLE, F-34790 GRABELS, FRANCE",ISI,NOTREPORTED,NOTREPORTED,,"PLA G, 2019, HOUILLE BLANCHE-REV INT","PLA G, 2019, HOUILLE BLANCHE-REV INT",TRUE,1,4_6,0,1_2,0,0,1_4,1,2
364,Kostadinov S;Dragicevic S;Stefanovic T;Novkovic I;Petrovic Ma,Torrential flood prevention in the kolubara river basin,JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE,"One of the most vulnerable parts to natural hazards in serbia is kolubara river basin. In the past, during the period from 1929 to 2013, 121 torrential flood events in the kolubara river basin were recorded which show that this territory is extremely vulnerable to the torrential floods. The extreme event which occurred in may 2014 causing the catastrophic material damages and casualties was the latest and historical flood. The analysis of natural conditions in the kolubara basin uniformly showed that this area is predisposed to a greater number of torrential floods due to its geomorphological, hydrological and land use properties. Torrential floods are closely related to the intensity and spatial distribution of erosive processes in the upper part of the kolubara basin. The estimation of soil erosion potential is generally achieved by erosion potential model (epm). For the purposes of determining the degree of torrential properties in various water streams in the kolubara basin, the calculation of susceptibility to torrential floods was assessed by flash flood potential index (ffpi). More than half of the basin area (57.2\%) is located within the category of very weak and weak erosion (z(sr)=0.35), but the category of medium erosion is geospatially very common. Such a distribution of medium erosion category provides conditions for generating, i.e. Production of sediment which would boost torrential properties of water streams. After the classification of the obtained ffpi values it was determined that 25\% of the kolubara basin is very susceptible to torrents and this data should be seriously taken into consideration. Based on the analyses, the best and most successful manner of defence is prevention which consists of the integrated river basin management system (integrated torrent control system) so that technical works in hydrographic networks of torrents and biological and biotechnical works on the slope of the basin would be the best solution. Permanent control of erosive and torrential processes in the river basin will be not only important for flood control but it can also protect the existing and future water reservoirs and retentions from siltation with erosion sediment which is of great significance to the water management, agriculture, energy sector, and the entire society.",SOIL EROSION; TORRENTIAL FLOODS; EROSION CONTROL WORKS; INTEGRATED RIVER BASIN MANAGEMENT,SOIL-EROSION; SEDIMENT YIELD; SERBIA; EUROPE; WATERSHEDS; COVER,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"AHMAD Z, 2015, J MT SCI-ENGL, V12, P972, DOI 10.1007/S11629-013-2892-1.;AMINI S, 2010, IRAN J EARTH SCI, V2, P173.;ANANDA J, 2003, J ENVIRON MANAGE, V68, P343, DOI 10.1016/S0301-4797(03)00082-3.;BAGHERZADEH A, 2011, FRONT EARTH SCI-PRC, V5, P207, DOI 10.1007/S11707-011-0168-Z.;BAKKER MM, 2005, AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON, V105, P467, DOI 10.1016/J.AGEE.2004.07.009.;BARMAKI M., 2012, INT RES J APPL BASIC, V3, P945.;BARREDO JI, 2007, NAT HAZARDS, V42, P125, DOI 10.1007/S11069-006-9065-2.;BRAZDIL R, 2006, HYDROLOG SCI J, V51, P739, DOI 10.1623/HYSJ.51.5.739.;[ CHENG GENWEI], 2011, [, JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE], V29, P561.;DE VENTE J, 2005, EARTH-SCI REV, V71, P95, DOI 10.1016/J.EARSCIREV.2005.02.002.;DRAGICEVIC S, 2011, INT J ENVIRON RES, V5, P371.;DRAGICEVIC S., 2006, B SERBIAN GEOGRAPHIC, V85, P37, DOI DOI 10.2298/GSGD0602037D.;DRAGICEVIC S., 2013, GEOMORPHOLOGICAL IMP, P155.;DRAGICEVIC S, 2017, ENVIRON ENG MANAG J, V16, P381, DOI 10.30638/EEMJ.2017.038.;DRAGICEVIC S, 2012, CARPATH J EARTH ENV, V7, P37.;DRAGICEVIC S, 2010, ADV GEOECOL, V41, P298.;DRAGIEVI S., 2016, REV GEOMORFOLOGIE, V18, P26.;DRAGIEVI S., 2007, COLLECTION PAPERS, V55, P39.;GAVRILOVIC S., 1972, J CONSTRUCTION.;HALL J, 2014, HYDROL EARTH SYST SC, V18, P2735, DOI 10.5194/HESS-18-2735-2014.;INSTITUTE FOR WATER MANAGEMENT JAROSLAV CERNI, 2016, STUD IMPR PROT WAT K.;KHALEDIAN Y, 2017, LAND DEGRAD DEV, V28, P128, DOI 10.1002/LDR.2541.;KOMAC B., 2009, REV GEOMORFOLOGIE, V11, P39.;KOSTADINOV S, 2007, INT C SEPT 2007 BELG.;KOSTADINOV S, 1996, IAHS PUBL, V236, P321.;KOSTADINOV S, 2003, P INT YEAR MOUNT C, P33.;KOSTADINOV S., 2017, ECOSYSTEM SERVICES H, P217.;KOSTADINOV S, 2008, IOP C SERIES EARTH E, V4, P1.;KOSTADINOV S, 2001, 19 EUR ICID, P54.;KOSTADINOV S, 2012, EROSION, V38, P1.;KOSTADINOV S, 2014, ADV GEOECOLOGY, V43, P156.;KOSTADINOV SC, 1994, J SOIL WATER CONSERV, V49, P382.;KOSTADINOV S, 2014, FRESEN ENVIRON BULL, V23, P254.;KOSTADINOV S, 2011, FRESEN ENVIRON BULL, V20, P1102.;KOSTADINOV S, 2010, GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE: CHALLENGES TO SCIENCE AND SOCIETY IN SOUTHEASTERN EUROPE, P177, DOI 10.1007/978-90-481-8695-2\_14.;LI S, 2014, HYDROL PROCESS, V28, P5573, DOI 10.1002/HYP.10018.;LIN W, 2017, J MT SCI-ENGL, V14, P1, DOI 10.1007/S11629-016-3945-Z.;LOPEZ-VICENTE M, 2013, CATENA, V102, P62, DOI 10.1016/J.CATENA.2011.01.001.;PETROVIC A, 2014, POL J ENVIRON STUD, V23, P823.;PETROVIC AM, 2015, NAT HAZARDS, V79, P537, DOI 10.1007/S11069-015-1860-1.;PRAVALIE R, 2014, FORUM GEOGRAFIC, V8, P39.;REPUBLIC HYDROMETEOROLOGICAL SERVICE OF SERBIA (RHMOS), MET HYDR ANN REP PRE.;RISTIC R, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P23, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-23-2012.;RISTIC R., 2009, B SERBIAN GEOGRAPHIC, V89, P161, DOI DOI 10.2298/GSGD0904161R.;SHARMA A, 2011, ENVIRON MONIT ASSESS, V173, P789, DOI 10.1007/S10661-010-1423-6.;SMITH G, 2003, FLASH FLOOD POTENTIA.;STEFANOVIC T., 2016, THESIS.;TAZIOLI A, 2009, ENVIRON GEOL, V56, P825, DOI 10.1007/S00254-007-1183-Y.;TOSIC R, 2012, CARPATH J EARTH ENV, V7, P147.;ZASLAVSKY MN, 1983, EROZIOVEDENIE, P1.;ZIVKOVIC N, 2015, FRESEN ENVIRON BULL, V24, P2082.;ZLATIC M, 2002, MT RES DEV, V22, P26, DOI 10.1659/0276-4741(2002)022[0026:EASROA]2.0.CO,2.","DRAGICEVIC, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV BELGRADE, FAC GEOG, STUDENTSKI TRG 3-3, BELGRADE 11000, SERBIA.;KOSTADINOV, STANIMIR, UNIV BELGRADE, FAC FORESTRY, KNEZA VISESLAVA 1, BELGRADE 11030, SERBIA.;DRAGICEVIC, SLAVOLJUB, NOVKOVIC, IVAN, UNIV BELGRADE, FAC GEOG, STUDENTSKI TRG 3-3, BELGRADE 11000, SERBIA.;STEFANOVIC, TOMISLAV, INST FORESTRY, KNEZA VISESLAVA 3, BELGRADE 11030, SERBIA.;PETROVIC, M.

108,Vincendon B;Edouard S;Dewaele H;Ducrocq V;Lespinas F;Delrieu G;Anquetin S,Modeling flash floods in southern france for road management purposes,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Flash-floods are among the most devastating hazards in the mediterranean. A major subset of damage and casualties caused by flooding is related to road submersion. Distributed hydrological nowcasting can be used for road flooding monitoring. This requires rainfall-runoff simulations at a high space and time resolution. Distributed hydrological models, such as the isba-top coupled system used in this study, are designed to simulate discharges for any cross-section of a river but they are generally calibrated for certain outlets and give deteriorated results for the sub-catchment outlets. The paper first analyses isba-top discharge simulations in the french mediterranean region for target points different from the outlets used for calibration. The sensitivity of the model to its governing factors is examined to highlight the validity of results obtained for ungauged river sections compared with those obtained for the main gauged outlets. The use of improved model inputs is found beneficial for sub-catchments simulation. The calibration procedure however provides the parameters' values for the main outlets only and these choices influence the simulations for ungauged catchments or sub-catchments. As a result, a new version of isba-top system without any parameter to calibrate is used to produce diagnostics relevant for quantifying the risk of road submersion. A first diagnostic is the simulated runoff spatial distribution, it provides a useful information about areas with a high risk of submersion. Then an indicator of the flood severity is given by simulated discharges presented with respect to return periods. The latter has to be used together with information about the vulnerability of road-river cross-sections. (C) 2016 elsevier b.v.

153,Conesa-Garcia C;Garcia-Lorenzo R;Perez-Cutillas P,Flood hazards at ford stream crossings on ephemeral channels (south-east coast of spain),HYDROLOGICAL PROCESSES,"Most road-stream crossings over ephemeral channels are vulnerable to extreme hydrologic events. Ford stream crossings (fscs) are usually dangerous for the road traffic during periods of high flow, in particular under flash flood conditions. The present paper analyzes the flood hazards on the mediterranean coast in the region of murcia (south-east spain), affecting this type of road-stream crossing over dry channels, according to hydraulic variables and bedload transport rates estimated for discharges at bankfull and flood-prone stages. Under such conditions, the safety of people and vehicles was obtained using numerical models, developed by previous researchers, in particular, water levels and flow velocities across ford reaches were compared with different trend curves between water depths and corresponding critical velocities for children and adults, and for various prototype vehicles. Specifically, two approaches to assess this type of hazards were proposed: a specific hydraulic hazard index and an algorithm for estimating the flood hazard from criteria of bed stability and bedload transport capacity (flood hazard at fords, fhf). In addition, different exposure levels were established, using a flood vulnerability index, based on the fhf, the road category, and the annual average daily traffic. The fhf model gave the best results with regard to the magnitude of the damage observed in recent flash floods for flow stages similar to those simulated. According to the danger thresholds established for this index, half-bankfull flows represent here a high risk: 27.3\% of fscs for mini-cars and 18.2\% for large cars. At bankfull, the fhf exhibits very high values for mini-cars (77.3\% of fscs) and for large passenger vehicles (50\% of fscs), while at the floodprone stage, extreme fhf values are reached for all kinds of vehicles at most of the ford crossings.",EPHEMERAL CHANNELS; FLOOD HAZARDS; FORDS; ROAD-STREAM CROSSINGS; SOUTH EAST COAST OF SPAIN,UNITED-STATES; HUMAN-BODY; STABILITY; FLOODWATERS; FATALITIES; CRITERION; EVENTS; TRANSPORT; AUSTRALIA; SEDIMENT,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,6,"AASHTO, 1992, GUID TRAFF DAT PROGR, P114.;ABT SR, 1989, WATER RESOUR BULL, V25, P881.;ACA (AGENCIA CATALANA DE L'AIGUA), 2004, GUIA TECN REC TECN D.;AEM AUSTRALIAN EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT HANDBOOK, 2014, AEM HDB, V7.;[ANONYMOUS], 2014, BBC.;[ANONYMOUS], 2000, PAIS.;ARRIGHI C, 2015, E P 36 IAHR WORLD C, P4.;ASHLEY ST, 2008, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V47, P805, DOI 10.1175/2007JAMC1611.1.;BARBETTA S., 2005, HYDROLOGICAL PERSPEC, V1, P78.;BUNTE K., 2015, SEDHYD JOINT 10 FED.;BURZEL A., 2012, DEV SPATIAL LOSS OF.;CALOIERO T, 2014, WATER-SUI, V6, P3652, DOI 10.3390/W6123652.;CHIEN N., 1956, T AM SOC CIVIL ENG, V121, P833.;COATES L, 1999, AUST GEOGR, V30, P391, DOI 10.1080/00049189993657.;COATES L., 2008, FLASH FLOOD SHELTERI.;COHEN H, 2010, WATER RESOUR RES, V46, DOI 10.1029/2010WR009160.;CONESA-GARCIA C, 2013, HYDROL PROCESS, V27, P1781, DOI 10.1002/HYP.9335.;CONESA-GARCIA C., 2003, B ASOC GEOGR ESP, V35, P79.;CONESA-GARCIA C., 2009, DAMS IMPACTS STABILI, P75.;CONESA-GARCIA C, 2017, HYDROL PROCESS, V31, P731, DOI 10.1002/HYP.11082.;CONESA-GARCIA C, 2010, REMOTE SENS-BASEL, V2, P2607, DOI 10.3390/RS2112607.;CONESAGARCIA C, 2005, Z GEOMORPHOL, V49, P205.;COWAN W., 1956, AGR ENG, V37, P473, DOI DOI 10.2514/2.6901.;COX R.

82,Molinari D;Ballio F;Menoni S,"Modelling the benefits of flood emergency management measures in reducing damages: a case study on sondrio, italy",NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"The european ``floods directive 2007/60/eu has produced an important shift from a traditional approach to flood risk management centred only on hazard analysis and forecast to a newer one which encompasses other aspects relevant to decision-making and which reflect recent research advances in both hydraulic engineering and social studies on disaster risk. This paper accordingly proposes a way of modelling the benefits of flood emergency management interventions calculating the possible damages by taking into account exposure, vulnerability, and expected damage reduction. The results of this model can be used to inform decisions and choices for the implementation of flood emergency management measures. A central role is played by expected damages, which are the direct and indirect consequence of the occurrence of floods in exposed and vulnerable urban systems. How damages should be defined and measured is a key question that this paper tries to address. The floods directive suggests that mitigation measures taken to reduce flood impact need to be evaluated also by means of a cost benefit analysis. The paper presents a methodology for assessing the effectiveness of early warning for flash floods, considering its potential impact in reducing direct physical damage, and it assesses the general benefit in regard to other types of damages and losses compared with the emergency management costs. The methodology is applied to the case study area of the city of sondrio in the northern alpine region of italy. A critical discussion follows the application.

182,Vieira I;Barreto V;Figueira C;Lousada S;Prada S,The use of detention basins to reduce flash flood hazard in small and steep volcanic watersheds - a simulation from madeira island,JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT,"Madeira, like many mountainous volcanic islands, is susceptible to flash floods. Throughout its history, about 40 large events resulted in more than 1200 victims and countless damages. Recently, urban areas expanded greatly, leading to a higher exposure of the population to flash floods. In order to analyse ways to reduce vulnerability and decrease hazard in the urbanised, flash flood prone watershed of the machico river, the construction of detention basins (db) is simulated. A hydrological and hydraulic model was performed to determine if they would be a viable option to protect downstream populations. Modelling suggests that two 12 m high outlet structures, and a storage capacity of 111 298 m(3) (db1) and 121 095 m(3) (db2), would reduce peak discharge by 72\%, from a precipitation event with a return period of 100 years. Two identified sensitive sections (s) had their fill rates reduced from 130.6\% to 79.6\% (s1) and from 128.6\% to 33.4\% (s2), thus preventing channel overflow. A concise economic analysis was made in terms of implementation and maintenance costs, as well as a swot analysis highlighting that db should be regarded as a viable engineering solution to reduce vulnerability to flash floods hazards in volcanic islands with small, steep, and urbanised watersheds.",100-YEAR RETURN PERIOD; EXTREME RAINFALL; HYDROLOGIC AND HYDRAULIC MODELLING; PEAK DISCHARGE ATTENUATION,20 FEBRUARY 2010; CLIMATE; MACARONESIA; MANAGEMENT; DESIGN; EVENT; RAIN,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"BRYANT E.

Despite the continuous quest for innovation from the scientific and user communities, ewss remain based mostly on hazard forecast, and the information on possible consequences and potential impacts is generally missing. In this work, a methodology for quantitative real-time impact assessment for flash floods is presented. The methodology uses a multi-model ensemble approach and considers soil moisture uncertainty. Moreover, the flood forecasting chain, which normally provides only the discharge probability of exceeding a given threshold, is extended to include a fully 2d hydraulic model and a damage estimation model to quantitatively assess impacts in terms of economic losses and the people involved. The procedure was tested on recent flood events occurring in genoa in northwestern italy.

Besides, the complex topographic and geomorphological characteristics of hilly areas increase the uncertainty of rainfall threshold calculation. This study aims to explore the comprehensive assessment and recheck method for rainfall threshold of flash floods, primarily considering the impact of disaster information. We used the time-interval characteristic rainfall and analytic hierarchy process (ahp) to evaluate the rationality discriminant factor and the weight of warning durations, as well as determined the comprehensive rationality index (cri) and assessed and rechecked the overall rationality of the rainfall threshold of disaster prevention objects. Then, the time-interval characteristic rainfall assessment method was used to validate the rationality of the rainfall threshold rechecked value against information from a historical actual flash flood. We found that (1) the cri could effectively distinguish the overall rationality of the rainfall threshold of disaster prevention objects, (2) the cri of critical rainfall rechecked value increased by about 40\%, and the qualified rate of historical flood verification reached 75\%, which corroborated more with the actual situation of the study area. Thus, this study elucidates the comprehensive assessment and recheck method and enhancing the rainfall threshold rationality assessment system, offering a valuable reference for the analysis and calculation of early warning indicators of a flash flood.",ASSESSMENT AND RECHECK; COMPREHENSIVE RATIONALITY INDEX; DISASTER INFORMATION; FLASH FLOOD; RAINFALL THRESHOLD,PREDICTION; TOOLS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"FU, L (REPRINT AUTHOR), ZHENGZHOU UNIV, COLL WATER CONSERVANCY \& ENVIRONM, ZHENGZHOU 450001, HENAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.;WAN, F (REPRINT AUTHOR), NORTH CHINA UNIV WATER RESOURCES \& ELECT POWER, SCH WATER CONSERVANCY, ZHENGZHOU 450045, HENAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.;YUAN, WENLIN, FU, LEI, GAO, QIANYU, ZHENGZHOU UNIV, COLL WATER CONSERVANCY \& ENVIRONM, ZHENGZHOU 450001, HENAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.;WAN, FANG, NORTH CHINA UNIV WATER RESOURCES \& ELECT POWER, SCH WATER CONSERVANCY, ZHENGZHOU 450045, HENAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.1007/S11269-019-02321-9,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,NATURAL SCIENCES FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [51779229]; HENAN PROVINCE YOUNG BACKBONE TEACHERS TRAINING PROGRAM PROJECT [2016GGJS-004],,0920-4741,10,3547-3562,SPRINGER,33,2019,ISI000481790200013,24,"ENGINEERING, WATER RESOURCES",22,"ENGINEERING, CIVIL, WATER RESOURCES",570840473QQ.COM WANXF1023163.COM,,IR9TX,,"FU, L (REPRINT AUTHOR), ZHENGZHOU UNIV, COLL WATER CONSERVANCY \& ENVIRONM, ZHENGZHOU 450001, HENAN, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,ZHENGZHOU UNIV;NORTH CHINA UNIV WATER RESOURCES AND ELECT POWER,ZHENGZHOU UNIV,,"YUAN W, 2019, WATER RESOUR MANAG","YUAN W, 2019, WATER RESOUR MANAG",FALSE,2,0,0,2,0,0,1_4_11,0,2

The purpose of this study is to assess flood damage due to flash wadi (dry river bed) flooding in dhofar under present and future sea level conditions. This study uses a 3di hydrodynamic model and a damage model to quantify the flood extent and flood damage due to the 2002 cyclonic storm (arb01) and to identify vulnerable infrastructure in two watersheds: zayk and ghadow. The impact of the storm is assessed under present day and predicted 1.41 m sea level rise (slr) conditions. The results show that with present sea level conditions the residential damage was estimated at us\$ 10.79m and us\$ 32.98m for zayk and ghadow respectively. Under a 1.41 m slr scenario, the residential damage is projected to increase to us\$ 13.65m (26.5\%) and us\$ 40.28m (22.1\%) for zayk and ghadow respectively under a similar cyclonic storm event. These results provide knowledge to make informed policy decisions that contribute to the development of resilient infrastructure.

160,Samu R;Kentel As,An analysis of the flood management and mitigation measures in zimbabwe for a sustainable future,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,"Floods have prevailed in the recent years, hampering not only social but also the economic development as well. This global pandemic has caused loss of lives, property and economic damages in many countries, including zimbabwe. Rainfall intensity in the country's seven main river catchments namely, mzingwane, gwayi, save (or sabi), mazowe (or mazoe), sanyati, manyame and runde triggers flash floods due to high peak discharges. It is therefore of paramount importance to try and reduce or rather prevent these losses due to flood events. The main objective of this study is to ascertain flood events in zimbabwe and discuss how best they can be managed for a sustainable future. The assessment is carried out using aqueduct global flood analyzer in which all the analysis is based on the gross domestic product (gdp), population and the present and future (2030) urban damage. To estimate future changes and effectively suggest flood disaster management and mitigation strategies, three scenarios obtained from the intergovernmental panel on climate change 5th assessment report were utilized. A 5-year flood protection was then employed and the urban damage due to the flood events, the population at risk and the effects of this disaster on gdp was determined. This study outlined that in any given year, the majority of zimbabwe has a low to a medium that is 2-3\% probability of flood occurrence in which a 5-year flood has a 20\% occurrence probability in any given year. If there is no flood protection employed, this 5-year flood could cause \$106.3 thousand affected population, \$32.4 million urban damage and \$67.9 million affected gdp. It is concluded that it is impossible to completely eliminate flood events, however, proposed mitigation measures, diminution approach and proper planning and preparation before their occurrence can reduce the environmental, economic and social losses.",FLOOD PROTECTION; FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT; PRECIPITATION; SUSTAINABLE FLOOD MANAGEMENT; ZIMBABWE,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; RISK-REDUCTION; VULNERABILITY; STRATEGIES; RESILIENCE; CITIES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,"ABHAS K., 2011, ROBIN BLOCH CITIES F.;ANALYZER AGF, 2016, FLOODS WRI ORG.;[ANONYMOUS], 2016, AQUEDUCT WATER RISK.;ASUMADU-SARKODIE S., 2015, INT J SCI ENG RES, V6.;ASUMADU-SARKODIE S., 2015, GHANA ADV APPL SCI R.;DODMAN D, 2017, INT J DISAST RISK RE, V26, P7, DOI 10.1016/J.IJDRR.2017.06.029.;EILANDER D., 2017, GLOBAL COASTAL FLOOD.;GASSERT F., 2014, AQUEDUCT GLOBAL MAPS.;ICELAND C., 2017, AQUEDUCT GLOBAL FLOO.;IEE, 2013, IEEE PUBL FOST EARTH.;LI L.

48,Garrote J;Alvarenga Fm;Diez-Herrero A,Quantification of flash flood economic risk using ultra-detailed stage-damage functions and 2-d hydraulic models,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The village of pajares de pedraza (segovia, spain) is located in the floodplain of the cega river, a left bank tributary of the douro river. Repeated flash flood events occur in this small village because of its upstream catchment area, mountainous character and impermeable lithology, which reduce concentration time to just a few hours. River overbank flow has frequently caused flooding and property damage to homes and rural properties, most notably in 1927, 1991, 1996, 2001, 2013 and 2014. Consequently, a detailed analysis was carried out to quantify the economic risk of flash floods in peri-urban and rural areas. Magnitudes and exceedance probabilities were obtained from a flood frequency analysis of maximum discharges. To determine the extent and characteristics of the flooded area, we performed 2d hydraulic modeling (iber 2.0 software) based on lidar (1 m) topography and considering three different scenarios associated with the initial construction (1997) and subsequent extension (2013) of a linear defense structure (rockfill dike or levee) to protect the population. Specific stage-damage functions were expressly developed using in situ data collection for exposed elements, with special emphasis on urban-type categories. The average number of elements and their unit value were established. The relationship between water depth and the height at which electric outlets, furniture, household goods, etc. Were located was analyzed, due to its effect on the form of the function. Other nonspecific magnitude-damage functions were used in order to compare both economic estimates. The results indicate that the use of non-specific magnitude-damage functions leads to a significant overestimation of economic losses, partly linked to the use of general economic cost data. Furthermore, a detailed classification and financial assessment of exposed assets is the most important step to ensure a correct estimate of financial losses.

287,Ghimire Cp;Bonell M;Bruijnzeel La;Coles Na;Lubczynski Mw,Reforesting severely degraded grassland in the lesser himalaya of nepal: effects on soil hydraulic conductivity and overland flow production,JOURNAL OF GEOPHYSICAL RESEARCH-EARTH SURFACE,"Severely degraded hillslopes in the lesser himalaya challenge local communities as a result of the frequent occurrence of overland flow and erosion during the rainy season and water shortages during the dry season. Reforestation is often perceived as an effective way of restoring predisturbance hydrological conditions but heavy usage of reforested land in the region has been shown to hamper full recovery of soil hydraulic properties. This paper investigates the effect of reforestation and forest usage on field-saturated soil hydraulic conductivities (k-fs) near dhulikhel, central nepal, by comparing degraded pasture, a footpath within the pasture, a 25 year old pine reforestation, and little disturbed natural forest. The hillslope hydrological implications of changes in k-fs with land-cover change were assessed via comparisons with measured rainfall intensities over different durations. High surface and near-surface k-fs in natural forest (82-232mmh(-1)) rule out overland flow occurrence and favor vertical percolation. Conversely, corresponding k-fs for degraded pasture (18-39mmh(-1)) and footpath (12-26mmh(-1)) were conducive to overland flow generation during medium- to high-intensity storms and thus to local flash flooding. Pertinently, surface and near-surface k-fs in the heavily used pine forest remained similar to those for degraded pasture. Estimated monsoonal overland flow totals for degraded pasture, pine forest, and natural forest were 21.3\%, 15.5\%, and 2.5\% of incident rainfall, respectively, reflecting the relative ranking of surface k-fs. Along with high water use by the pines, this lack of recovery of soil hydraulic properties under pine reforestation is shown to be a critical factor in the regionally observed decline in base flows following large-scale planting of pines and has important implications for regional forest management.",DRY SEASON FLOWS; FOREST HYDROLOGY; INFILTRATION; RUNOFF GENERATION; SOIL DEGRADATION,HUMID FOREST ECOSYSTEMS; LAND-USE; NORTHERN THAILAND; MIDDLE HILLS; RUNOFF GENERATION; TROPICAL FOREST; HYDROLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES; PENINSULAR MALAYSIA; WATER INFILTRATION; KABHRE-PALANCHOK,ENGLISH,REVIEW,ARTICLE,21,"ALEGRE JC, 1996, AGR ECOSYST ENVIRON, V58, P39, DOI 10.1016/0167-8809(95)00654-0.;[ANONYMOUS], 2012, REPUBLICA, VIV.;BAGSTAD KJ, 2013, ECOSYST SERV, V5, PE27, DOI 10.1016/J.ECOSER.2013.07.004.;BAIDYA S.K., 2008, J HYDROL MET, V5, P38.;BANDHYOPADHYAY J., 2013, 19 PUND GOV BALL PAN.;BARAL T., 2012, THESIS U TWNTE ENSCH.;BARTARYA S, 1989, HEADWATER CONTROL, P308.;BECK HE, 2013, HYDROL EARTH SYST SC, V17, P2613, DOI 10.5194/HESS-17-2613-2013.;BELL TIW, 1973, COMMONW FOREST REV, V52, P223.;BLAKE G.R., 1986, METHODS SOIL ANAL, P363, DOI DOI 10.2136/SSSAB00KSER5.1.2ED.C13.;BODHINAYAKE W, 2004, VADOSE ZONE J, V3, P964.;BONELL M, 2010, J HYDROL, V391, P49, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2010.07.004.;BONELL M, 1983, INT ASS HYDROLOGICAL, V140, P287.;BONELL M, 2005, INT HYDROL SER, P314.;BRUIJNZEEL L A, 1989, JOURNAL OF TROPICAL FOREST SCIENCE, V1, P229.;BRUIJNZEEL L.

Fieldwork, rainfall and flow rate monitoring, and numerical modeling were conducted to evaluate different scenarios combining storage tank capacity, two types of storage operations, and different locations by land use and watershed sectoring. These results showed that it is possible to reduce significantly the peak flow with small-capacity tanks distributed in the urban watershed with hydraulic structures that divide the discharge during the peak-flow time interval. By storing 3-17\% of the runoff volume, equivalent to a dispersed storage capacity from 4 to 19 mm rainfall, it is possible to reduce the peak flow from 25 to 75\%. These results demonstrate the advantages of using low impact development for stormwater management in consolidated cities with limited space, if regulatory policies encourage the massive use of lid in existing buildings.

The system is divided into four components: (i) measuring equipment with rainfall and flow rate gauges, datalogging and transmission, (ii) a system for database processing and a web interface, (iii) a numerical rainfall-runoff model in pcswmm calibrated and validated, and (iv) a reactive early warning model for determining the hazard level, and for making decisions of alertness along the main streets. Twelve (12) rainfall gauges were installed in the city, covering around 150 km(2). The numerical model in pcswmm was calibrated and validated with rainfall and flow rate data measured in a typical subcatchment of the city. A time of concentration equation was developed from the characteristics of the subcatchment such as slope and length. A pilot urban watershed was selected to test the system, from which hazard alerts every minute with forecasting of up to 40 minutes ahead on the lower parts of the watershed were determined. That time may allow people to make prompt decisions regarding their mobility over the city and reducing accidents caused by flash floods.",EARLY WARNING MODEL; FLASH FLOOD; HAZARD; RAINFALL-RUNOFF MODELING,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,"VILA HUMBERTO, 2012, REV.ING., P54.;COX R.

398,Mahtab Mh;Ohara M;Rasmy M,Effectiveness of the submersible embankment in haor area in bangladesh,JOURNAL OF DISASTER RESEARCH,"The north-eastern part of bangladesh is very productive for agriculture and fishing, and the region involves several depressed (haor) areas. Flash floods during the pre-monsoon period bring devastating damage to agriculture in the haor region recurrently. To protect crops from flash floods, the bangladesh water development board constructed several ringtype submersible embankments. In this research, we have investigated the effectiveness of submersible embankments in controlling flash flooding in the matian and shanir haors in the sunamganj district. A two-dimensional rainfall runoff inundation model was applied considering several scenarios for simulating heavy flash flood events in 2004, 2010, and 2016. Without an embankment, the river overflow would have entered the matian haor 3 days, 22 days, and 9 days earlier in 2004, 2010, and 2016, respectively, whereas it would have been 7 days and 23 days earlier in 2004 and 2010 for the shanir haor. The event in 2016 was successfully stopped by the shanir haor embankment. To avoid river overflow entering into the matian and shanir haor completely, the embankment height must be elevated further by 1 m and 0.7 m, respectively. Providing proper drainage facilities for the accumulated rain water inside the hoar is still an important issue for protecting the crops effectively.",HAOR; AGRICULTURE; FLASH FLOOD; EMBANKMENT; RRI MODEL,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"ALAM MK, 2010, J CONSTR DEV CTRIES, V15, P69.;ALAM M.

The hydrograph for the solid discharge is then estimated by scaling up the liquid volume to the estimated debris volume. The debris flow diffusion is simulated by solving the differential equations for a single-phase 2d flow employing triangular mesh elements, taking into account also the channelling of the flow through the buildings. The damage to the building is modelled, based on the maximum hydraulic actions caused by the debris flow, using 2d finite shell elements to model the building, boundary conditions provided by the openings, floor slab, orthogonal wall panels, and the foundation.

298,Ray Pkc;Chattoraj Sl;Bisht Mps;Kannaujiya S;Pandey K;Goswami A,Kedarnath disaster 2013: causes and consequences using remote sensing inputs,NATURAL HAZARDS,"Kedarnath was devastated on 16th evening-17th morning (june 2013) due to landslides and flash floods that killed more than 5000 people in uttarakhand. What really happened on 16th evening through next 12 h till final deluge on 17th morning has been a subject of speculation due to lack of sufficient eye witness and monitoring system. Earth observation techniques have provided information on precipitation, landslides, snow cover and other ancillary data such as digital elevation models at varying resolution. Using such spatial information along with limited eye witness and media reports, an attempt is made to reconstruct events that led to destruction in upper mandakini valley with prime aim to improve response and minimise damage in the event of similar disaster in future. The study has revealed that there were two distinct events separated by a time gap of 10-12 h: the first event was triggered by series of landslides, river blockades, breaching, flooding and river bank failures, whereas the second event was mainly associated with chorabari tal lake outburst flooding along with associated landslides and bank erosion. Comprehensive assessment of landslide hazard requires process-based modelling using numerical simulation methods. The present study aims to focus on analysis of landslides/debris flow movements and simulate landslides that occurred in kedarnath event leading to derivation of important flow parameters to get closer to the root cause of the devastation. The unique geomorphological setting, which has changed significantly in the recent event, provides valuable inputs for critical assessment of damage and remedial measures in future.

Through field survey and numerical simulation the causes of the disaster are systematically analyzed, finding that the intense storm, terrain features, and the large woody debris (lwd) played important roles. The intense storm induced fast runoff and, in turn, high discharges as a result of the steep catchment surfaces and channels. The flood flushed lwd and boulders downstream until blockage occurred in a contraction section, forming a debris lake. When the debris dam broke, a dam break wave rapidly propagated to the valley mouth, washing people away. After considering the disaster-inducing factors, measures for preventing similar floods are proposed. The analysis presented herein should help others manage flash floods in mountain areas.",DAM BREAK; DEBRIS DAM; FLASH FLOOD; FLOOD MANAGEMENT; LARGE WOODY DEBRIS,MODEL; RISK,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"HOU, JM (REPRINT AUTHOR), XIAN UNIV TECHNOL, STATE KEY LAB ECOHYDRAUL NORTHWEST ARID REG CHINA, 5 JINHUA RD, XIAN 710048, PEOPLES R CHINA.;HOU, JINGMING, LI, BINGYAO, TONG, YU, MA, LIPING, XIAN UNIV TECHNOL, STATE KEY LAB ECOHYDRAUL NORTHWEST ARID REG CHINA, 5 JINHUA RD, XIAN 710048, PEOPLES R CHINA.;BALL, JAMES, UNIV TECHNOL SYDNEY, SCH CIVIL \& ENVIRONM ENGN, SYDNEY, NSW 2006, AUSTRALIA.;LUO, HUI, METEOROL BUR SHAANXI PROV, 102-1 WEIYANG RD, XIAN 710015, PEOPLES R CHINA.;LIANG, QIUHUA, LOUGHBOROUGH UNIV, SCH ARCHITECTURE BLDG \& CIVIL ENGN, LOUGHBOROUGH LE11 3TU, LEICS, ENGLAND.;XIA, JUNQIANG, WUHAN UNIV, STATE KEY LAB WATER RESOURCES \& HYDROPOWER ENGN S, WUHAN 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.2166/NH.2019.091,"ALLIANCE HOUSE, 12 CAXTON ST, LONDON SW1H0QS, ENGLAND",,"WATER CONSERVANCY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PROJECT OF SHAANXI PROVINCE [2017SLKJ-14]; NATIONAL KEY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM OF CHINA [2016YFC0402704]; NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [51609199]; SHAANXI INTERNATIONAL SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY FOUNDATION OF CHINA [2017KW-014]; VISITING RESEARCHER FUND PROGRAM OF STATE KEY LABORATORY OF WATER RESOURCES AND HYDROPOWER ENGINEERING SCIENCE [2016HLG01]",,0029-1277,1,1-16,IWA PUBLISHING,51,2020,ISI000519243100001,19,WATER RESOURCES,1,WATER RESOURCES,JINGMING.HOUXAUT.EDU.CN,,KT8DV,,"HOU, JM (REPRINT AUTHOR), XIAN UNIV TECHNOL, STATE KEY LAB ECOHYDRAUL NORTHWEST ARID REG CHINA, 5 JINHUA RD, XIAN 710048, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,XIAN UNIV TECHNOL;UNIV TECHNOL SYDNEY;METEOROL BUR SHAANXI PROV;LOUGHBOROUGH UNIV;WUHAN UNIV,XIAN UNIV TECHNOL,,"HOU J, 2020, HYDROL RES","HOU J, 2020, HYDROL RES",TRUE,0,0,1,0,0,1,1_4_16,0,5
307,Molini L;Parodi A;Siccardi F,Dealing with uncertainty: an analysis of the severe weather events over italy in 2006,NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Forecast verification is a long-standing issue of the whole meteorologists' community. A common definition of a truly satisfying prediction skill has not been achieved so far. Even the definition of `event', due to its spatio-temporal discontinuity, is highly affected by uncertainty. Moreover, decision-making demands numerical weather prediction modellers to provide information about the `inner' uncertainty, i.e. The degree of uncertainty related to the choice of a specific setting of the model (microphysics, turbulence scheme, convective closure, etc.). Most european mediterranean countries, due to dense development, steep coastal orography and short hydrological response time of the drainage basins, have to deal very frequently with flash floods and sudden shallow land sliding impacting on urban areas. Civil protection organizations are in place to issue early warnings in order to allow local authorities and population to take precautionary measures. To do so in mediterranean catchments, hydrologists are required to use numerical rainfall predictions in place of rainfall observations on large european catchments. Estimating the measure of uncertainty is for this reason crucial. The goal of this work is to propose an objective evaluation of the performance of the currently operational weather prediction model cosmo-i7 over quite a long time period and to check forecast verification at different space-time scales by the comparison of predictions with observations. Due to large investments in the last years, in fact, italy has built up one of the most dense hourly-reporting network of rain gauges. The network has a mean space density of about 1/100 km(2), very similar to the horizontal resolution of currently operating limited area models. An objective procedure to identify and compare the extreme events of precipitation has been applied to the full set of rainfall observations and over the severe events forecast by cosmo-i7 and announced in official warnings by italian civil protection department. The procedure allows to classify rainfall events as long-lived and spatially distributed or as having a shorter duration and a minor spatial extent. We show that long-lived events are less affected by overall uncertainty than short-lived ones, yet the inner uncertainty of the event affects both.",,HEAVY PRECIPITATION; CONVECTION; RESOLUTION; RAINFALL; PREDICTION; FORECAST; MODEL,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,10,"*AVI IT RES COUNC, 2004, VULN AR IT PROJ FIN.","MOLINI, L (REPRINT AUTHOR), CIMA RES FDN, SAVONA, ITALY.;MOLINI, L., PARODI, A., SICCARDI, F., CIMA RES FDN, SAVONA, ITALY.;SICCARDI, F., UNIV GENOA, DEPT COMMUN COMP \& SYST, GENOA, ITALY.",10.5194/NHESS-9-1775-2009,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",,ITALIAN CIVIL PROTECTION DEPARTMENT; NASANATIONAL AERONAUTICS \& SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA); AMSR-E SCIENCE TEAM,,1561-8633,6,1775-1786,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,9,2009,ISI000273059800003,23,"GEOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",5,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",LUCA.MOLINICIMAFOUNDATION.ORG,,536QV,,"MOLINI, L (REPRINT AUTHOR), CIMA RES FDN, SAVONA, ITALY",ISI,CIMA RES FDN;UNIV GENOA,CIMA RES FDN,,"MOLINI L, 2009, NAT HAZARDS EARTH SYST SCI","MOLINI L, 2009, NAT HAZARDS EARTH SYST SCI",FALSE,1_2,0,0,1,0,0,1_4_16,1_2,2
321,Ravazzani G;Amengual A;Ceppi A;Homar V;Romero R;Lombardi G;Mancini M,Potentialities of ensemble strategies for flood forecasting over the milano urban area,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Analysis of ensemble forecasting strategies, which can provide a tangible backing for flood early warning procedures and mitigation measures over the mediterranean region, is one of the fundamental motivations of the international hymex programme. Here, we examine two severe hydrometeorological episodes that affected the milano urban area and for which the complex flood protection system of the city did not completely succeed. Indeed, flood damage have exponentially increased during the last 60 years, due to industrial and urban developments. Thus, the improvement of the milano flood control system needs a synergism between structural and non-structural approaches. First, we examine how land-use changes due to urban development have altered the hydrological response to intense rainfalls. Second, we test a flood forecasting system which comprises the flash-flood event-based spatially distributed rainfall-runoff transformation, including water balance (fest-wb) and the weather research and forecasting (wrf) models. Accurate forecasts of deep moist convection and extreme precipitation are difficult to be predicted due to uncertainties arising from the numeric weather prediction (nwp) physical parameterizations and high sensitivity to misrepresentation of the atmospheric state, however, two hydrological ensemble prediction systems (heps) have been designed to explicitly cope with uncertainties in the initial and lateral boundary conditions (ic/lbcs) and physical parameterizations of the nwp model. No substantial differences in skill have been found between both ensemble strategies when considering an enhanced diversity of ic/lbcs for the perturbed initial conditions ensemble. Furthermore, no additional benefits have been found by considering more frequent lbcs in a mixed physics ensemble, as ensemble spread seems to be reduced. These findings could help to design the most appropriate ensemble strategies before these hydrometeorological extremes, given the computational cost of running such advanced hepss for operational purposes.

303,Sharif Ho;Chintalapudi S;Hassan Aa;Xie H;Zeitler J,"Physically based hydrological modeling of the 2002 floods in san antonio, texas",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGIC ENGINEERING,"The july 2002 floods in south texas resulted from excessive precipitation caused by a slow moving tropical wave accompanied by an abundance of tropical moisture, which resulted in 12 deaths and nearly \$1 billion in damage. South central texas is particularly vulnerable to floods because of: (1) its proximity to a moist air source (the gulf of mexico), (2) the balcones escarpment, which concentrates rainfall runoff, (3) a tendency for synoptic scale features to become cut off and stall over the area, and (4) decaying tropical cyclones stalling over the area. This paper examines the hydrology of the july 2002 floods in three urbanized watersheds in the city of san antonio and bexar county, texas. The physically based, distributed parameter gridded surface subsurface hydrologic analysis hydrologic model was used to simulate the flood over the three watersheds. Various flood control features were included in the simulations. The hydrologic model, driven by the next generation radar multi-sensor precipitation estimator, was able to reasonably simulate runoff in the three watersheds. Differences in the responses of the three watersheds were highlighted with the role of flood-control hydraulic structures. Doi: 10.1061/(asce)he.19435584.0000475.

Point rainfall totals as high as 27.84cm (10.96in.) Occurred in this watershed in a 12-h period, causing severe flood damage to 1,185 residential properties. By validating hydrologic and hydraulic models representative of watershed conditions at the time of the storm, this study provides a comprehensive spatial perspective and understanding of the flows and stages, floodplain extents and depths, and residential damages that occurred. In addition, project brays, one of the largest urban watershed-scale flood reduction projects in the nation, was nearly halfway complete at the time of the 2015 memorial day storm. Subsequently, this study evaluates and compares the flood response to this rainfall event for different watershed conditions representing preproject conditions (2001), may 2015 conditions (current), and postproject conditions (2021 at the earliest).

The case of the 2017 mandra flash flood in greece,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,"On november 15, 2017, a high intensity convective storm, reaching 300 mm in 13 h in the core zone of the event, hit the western part of the region of attica in greece, causing a catastrophic flash flood in the town of mandra and a tragic loss of 24 people, making it the most deadly flood in the country, in a period of 40 years. The research team surveyed the area during and after the flood using a combination of systematic ground and aerial observations with the aid of an unmanned aerial vehicle (uav), aiming to reconstruct the basic physical and hydrological characteristics of the flood and its impacts. The analysis produced detailed flood extent and depth maps that provided a comprehensive description of the physical characteristics of floodwaters across the inundated area. Peak discharge was estimated, using a  uav-derived digital surface model, at two locations, corresponding to the two main tributaries and indicated an impressive hydrological response, between 9 and 10 m(3)/s/km(2). Impact analysis on the basis of these observations showed an extensive diversity, including effects in geomorphology, vegetation, buildings, infrastructure and human population. Analysis of meteorological, botanical and geomorphological evidence lead to the conclusion that this flash flood was a very rare event. Results demonstrate that the combination of aerial and ground observations allow an enhanced and holistic reconstruction of a flash flood and its impacts with high accuracy, leading to the conclusion that the approach used has a significant potential in many aspects of flood disaster investigations.",,STRUCTURE-FROM-MOTION; HYDROLOGICAL ANALYSIS; METROPOLITAN-AREA; IMPACTS; RADAR; WESTERN; DATABASE; FRANCE; EUROPE; RISK,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,10,none,"DIAKAKIS, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ATHENS, FAC GEOL \& GEOENVIRONM, ATHENS, GREECE.;DIAKAKIS, M., ANDREADAKIS, E., SPYROU, N., I, GOGOU, M.

577,Tunas Ig;Tanga A;Oktavia Sr,"Impact of landslides induced by the 2018 palu earthquake on flash flood in bangga river basin, sulawesi, indonesia",JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"High magnitude flash flood has occurred several times in some areas in central sulawesi province after the 2018 palu earthquake, one of them is in the bangga river, sigi regency, indonesia. It has caused massive impacts such as damaging agricultural and plantation areas and submerging public facilities and infrastructure and even causing fatalities. The flood carries a variety of materials, especially high concentration sediments which are thought to originate from eroded soils due to landslides induced by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake. These materials are eroded and transported by the flow at the upstream watershed due to heavy rainfall. This study intends to investigate the potential of landslides, factors that trigger floods and increased flooding after the earthquake. This research was conducted by investigating the landslides potency based on field surveys and interpretation of the latest satellite imagery, analyzing the characteristics of rainfall as a trigger for flooding, and predicting the flood potency as the primary impact of these two factors. Rainfall-flood transformation was simulated with the hec-hms model, one of the freeware semi-distributed models commonly used in hydrological analysis. The model input is the configuration of river networks generated from the national dem (demnas), hourly rainfall during floods and other watershed parameters such as land cover, soil types and river slope. The similar simulation was also carried out on the condition of the watershed before the earthquake. Based on the results of the analysis, it can be inferred that flash floods in the bangga river are mainly caused by heavy rainfall with long duration and landslide areas in the upper watershed triggered by the 2018 palu earthquake with an area of approximately 10.8 km(2). The greatest depth of rainfall as a trigger for flooding is 30.4 mm with a duration of 8 hours. The results of the study also showed that landslides in the upper watershed could increase the peak flood by 33.33\% from 118.56 m(3)/s to 158.08 m(3)/s for conditions before and after the earthquake.",FLASH FLOOD; HEAVY RAINFALL; LANDSLIDE; WATERSHED; THE 2018 PALU EARTHQUAKE,SIMULATION; CATCHMENT; RAINFALL,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"TUNAS, IG (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV TADULAKO, FAC ENGN, DEPT CIVIL ENGN, KAMPUS BUMI TADULAKO TONDO,JALAN SOEKARNO HATTA, PALU 94117, CENTRAL SULAWES, INDONESIA.;TUNAS, I.

576,Ourloglou O;Stefanidis K;Mitriou Ed,Assessing nature-based and classical engineering solutions for flood-risk reduction in urban streams,JOURNAL OF ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,"Urbanization of stream ecosystems with the purpose of managing the flash-flood events is nowadays considered responsible for habitat loss and alteration of the natural flow regime with severe implications for the ecosystem functioning. Unsurprisingly, the river scientists have started seeking alternative options inspired from nature for mitigating the flood-risk and maintaining the stream at its natural state. With this article the authors demonstrate the effects of a nature-based solution (nbs) for managing an urban stream based on the use of bioengineering materials (e.g. Plants) and the implementation of the actions that restore the stream to its natural form (e.g channel widening). The hec-ras software was employed to simulate the flow and hydraulic components of an approximately 800m long reach of an urban stream under three different scenarios of flood risk management with a design flow set to 400 m(3)/s. The first scenario was based on the current situation of the stream, the second scenario concerned the stream restoration by following the nature-based solutions, while the third scenario was based on the classical ``grey engineering approach of concrete channelization. Unmanned aerial vehicle (uav) photogrammetry methods and the pix4dmapper software were used in order to develop a detailed 3d model of the studied reach that accurately captured the current geomorphology. The obtained results showed that with concrete channelization, the average and maximum flow of the stream increases significantly in relation to the current situation, from 2.48 and 4.88m/s to 9.82 and 11.22 m/s, respectively, while the average froude number raises from 0.36 to 1.69 implying super-critical flows. In contrast, the nbs scenario retained lower flow velocities and average froude number similar to those under the current conditions. In addition, a cost estimation analysis for both stream management techniques revealed that the nbs is much cheaper than the traditional channelization (1.1 mil (sic) vs 5.6 mil (sic)). In conclusion, our findings suggest that the future restoration of urban streams should consider the nature-based solutions since i) they can be effective with regard to the reduction of flood-risk, ii) are cheaper than the traditional ``grey techniques and, most importantly, iii) maintain the natural state of the ecosystem which improves not only the ecosystem functioning but also the aesthetic value within the urban context.",URBAN STREAMS; STREAM RESTORATION; BIOENGINEERING; NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS; HYDRAULIC MODELLING; UAVS,URBANIZATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"MITRIOU, ED (REPRINT AUTHOR), HCMR, INST MARINE BIOL RESOURCES \& INLAND WATERS, 46-7 KM ATHENS,SOUNIO AVE, ATHENS 19013, GREECE.;OURLOGLOU, OLGA, HELLEN OPEN UNIV, SCH SCI \& TECHNOL, PARODOS ARISTOTELOUS 18, PATRAS 26335, GREECE.;STEFANIDIS, KONSTANTINOS, MITRIOU, ELIAS D., HCMR, INST MARINE BIOL RESOURCES \& INLAND WATERS, 46-7 KM ATHENS,SOUNIO AVE, ATHENS 19013, GREECE.",10.12911/22998993/116349,"LUBLIN UNIV TECHNOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL ENGINEERING FAC, LUBLIN, 20618, POLAND",,,,2299-8993,2,46-56,POLISH SOC ECOLOGICAL ENGINEERING,21,2020,ISI000514828100006,27,ENGINEERING,3,"ENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL",ELIASHCMR.GR,,KN4SJ,,"MITRIOU, ED (REPRINT AUTHOR), HCMR, INST MARINE BIOL RESOURCES \& INLAND WATERS, 46-7 KM ATHENS,SOUNIO AVE, ATHENS 19013, GREECE",ISI,HELLEN OPEN UNIV;INST MARINE BIOL RESOURCES AND INLAND WATERS,INST MARINE BIOL RESOURCES AND INLAND WATERS,,"OURLOGLOU O, 2020, J ECOL ENG","OURLOGLOU O, 2020, J ECOL ENG",FALSE,1,6,0,0,0,0,1_4_17,1,1

This leaves a challenge for characterisation, modelling, forecasting and management activities. Here we demonstrate the value of community-based ('citizen science') observations for modelling and understanding catchment response as a contribution to catchment science. The scheme implemented within the 42 km(2) haltwhistle burn catchment, a tributary of the river tyne in northeast england, has harvested and used quantitative and qualitative observations from the public in a novel way to effectively capture spatial and temporal river response. Community-based rainfall, river level and flood observations have been successfully collected and quality-checked, and used to build and run a physically-based, spatially-distributed catchment model, shetran. Model performance using different combinations of observations is tested against traditionally-derived hydro graphs. Our results show how the local network of community-based observations alongside traditional sources of hydro-information supports characterisation of catchment response more accurately than using traditional observations alone over both spatial and temporal scales. We demonstrate that these community-derived datasets are most valuable during local flash flood events, particularly towards peak discharge. This information is often missed or poorly represented by ground-based gauges, or significantly underestimated by rainfall radar, as this study clearly demonstrates. While community-based observations are less valuable during prolonged and widespread floods, or over longer hydrological periods of interest, they can still ground-truth existing traditional sources of catchment data to increase confidence during characterisation and management activities. Involvement of the public in data collection activities also encourages wider community engagement, and provides important information for catchment management. (C) 2017 the authors.

This paper shows that an ews is not a ``mission impossible when confronted with large technical and scientific uncertainties and limited data availability. Firstly, the ews has been developed and tested based on the best available information, this being quantitative data (field measurements, simulations and remote sensing images) complemented with qualitative ``expert opinion and local stakeholders' knowledge. Secondly, a set of essential parameters has been identified to be estimated or measured under data-poor conditions. These are: (1) an inventory of past significant rainfall and flash flood events, (2) the spatial and temporal distribution of the rainfall events and (3) transmission and infiltration losses and (4) thresholds for issuing warnings. Over a period of 30 yr (1979-2010), only 20 significant rain events have been measured. Nine of these resulted in a flash flood. Five flash floods were caused by regional storms and four by local convective storms. The results for the 2010 flash flood show that 90\% of the total rainfall volume was lost to infiltration and transmission losses. Finally, it is discussed that the effectiveness of an ews is only partially determined by technological performance. A strong institutional capacity is equally important, especially skilled staff to operate and maintain the system and clear communication pathways and emergency procedures in case of an upcoming disaster.",,EASTERN ITALIAN ALPS; RUNOFF; CATCHMENT; MANAGEMENT; DESERT; MODEL; GIS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,34,"ABDELKHALEK A., 2011, THESIS VUB BRUSSEL.;AL-QURASHI A, 2008, J HYDROL, V355, P91, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2008.03.022.;[ANONYMOUS], 2008, INFOWORKS RS VERS 9.;ANQUETIN S, 2010, J HYDROL, V394, P134, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2010.07.002.;BAHAT Y, 2009, J HYDROL, V373, P204, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2009.04.026.;BORGA M, 2008, HYDROL PROCESS, V22, P3883, DOI 10.1002/HYP.7111.;BORGA M, 2007, J HYDROMETEOROL, V8, P1049, DOI 10.1175/JHM593.1.;CHOW V.

To evaluate the application of this wof concept for probabilistic short-term flash flood prediction, the 0-3-h rainfall forecasts from noaa national severe storms laboratory's (nssl) experimental wof system (wofs) were integrated as the forcing to the nws operational hydrologic modeling core within the flooded locations and simulated hydrographs (flash) system. Initial assessment of the potential impacts of probabilistic short-term flash flood forecasts from this coupled atmosphere-hydrology (wofs-flash) modeling system were evaluated in the 2018 hydrometeorology testbed multi-radar multi-sensor hydrology experiment held in norman, oklahoma. During the 3-week experiment period, a total of nine nws forecasters analyzed three retrospective flash flood events in archive mode. This study will describe specifically what information participants extracted from the wofs-flash products during these three archived events, and how this type of information is expected to impact operational decision-making processes. Overall feedback from the testbed participants' evaluations show promise for the coupled nssl wofs-flash system probabilistic flash flood model guidance to enable earlier assessment and detection of flash flood threats and to advance the current warning lead time for these events.",HYDROMETEOROLOGY; OPERATIONAL FORECASTING; PROBABILISTIC QUANTITATIVE PRECIPITATION FORECASTING (PQPF); CLOUD RESOLVING MODELS; COMMUNICATIONS; DECISION MAKING; FLOOD EVENTS,DATA ASSIMILATION; ENSEMBLE; VERIFICATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"YUSSOUF, N (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV OKLAHOMA, COOPERAT INST MESOSCALE METEOROL STUDIES, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA.;YUSSOUF, N (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV OKLAHOMA, SCH METEOROL, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA.;YUSSOUF, N (REPRINT AUTHOR), NOAA, OAR, NATL SEVERE STORMS LAB, NORMAN, OK 73026 USA.;YUSSOUF, NUSRAT, WILSON, KATIE A., MARTINAITIS, STEVEN M., VERGARA, HUMBERTO, UNIV OKLAHOMA, COOPERAT INST MESOSCALE METEOROL STUDIES, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA.;YUSSOUF, NUSRAT, HEINSELMAN, PAM L., GOURLEY, JONATHAN J., UNIV OKLAHOMA, SCH METEOROL, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA.;YUSSOUF, NUSRAT, WILSON, KATIE A., MARTINAITIS, STEVEN M., VERGARA, HUMBERTO, NOAA, OAR, NATL SEVERE STORMS LAB, NORMAN, OK 73026 USA.;HEINSELMAN, PAM L., GOURLEY, JONATHAN J., UNIV OKLAHOMA, NOAA, OAR, NATL SEVERE STORMS LAB, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA.",10.1175/JHM-D-19-0131.1,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108-3693 USA",,"HYDROMETEOROLOGY TESTBED BY THE OFFICE OF WEATHER AND AIR QUALITY UNDER NOAA AWARD [NA17OAR4590281]; NOAA/OFFICE OF OCEANIC AND ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH UNDER NOAA-UNIVERSITY OF OKLAHOMA, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCENATIONAL OCEANIC ATMOSPHERIC ADMIN (NOAA) - USA [NA11OAR4320072]",,1525-755X,1,123-141,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOC,21,2020,ISI000509968100002,35,METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES,2,METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES,NUSRAT.YUSSOUFNOAA.GOV,,KG5DM,,"YUSSOUF, N (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV OKLAHOMA, COOPERAT INST MESOSCALE METEOROL STUDIES, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA",ISI,UNIV OKLAHOMA;UNIV OKLAHOMA;NATL SEVERE STORMS LAB;UNIV OKLAHOMA,UNIV OKLAHOMA,,"YUSSOUF N, 2020, J HYDROMETEOROL","YUSSOUF N, 2020, J HYDROMETEOROL",FALSE,2,0,0,1,0,0,1_4_6,0,1
316,Estrany J;Grimalt M,Catchment controls and human disturbances on the geomorphology of small mediterranean estuarine systems,ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE,"Geographic signatures are physical and human-induced characteristics or processes that identify comparable or unique features of estuaries along latitudinal gradients. In mediterranean areas, the microtidal regime and the strong seasonal and inter-annual contrasts cause an alternation between relatively high runoff and arid conditions. Furthermore, the long history of human settlement also increases the complexity in the study of these estuarine systems. This study investigates these signatures of the estuaries located within the mallorcan eastern coast, which are geomorphologically homogeneous because of a similar bedrock geology and holocene history. A multi-method approach focused on the integration of geomorphometry, hydraulics, historical sources and statistics was used. We explore the role played by catchment morphometric parameters, severe flash flood events and human disturbances in controlling the geomorphology of 10 beach-barrier enclosed, fluvial incised lagoons. Most of the lagoons discharge into `calas', ranging in size from 1345 to 17,537 m(2) and their related catchments are representative of the mediterranean hydrological systems. Multiple regression models illustrate that the size, slope and drainage network development of the catchments explain the variance in length (r(2)=0.67), volume (r(2)=0.49), area (r(2)=0.64), circularity (r(2)=0.72) and average width (r(2)=0.81) of the lagoons. Depending on these catchment morphometric variables, the shape of the lagoons is also determined by the occurrence of catastrophic flash floods, which cause scouring and dredging, whereas the ordinary flood events and sea storms promote refilling and sedimentation. A historical analysis since 1850 documented 18 flood events, 5 of which were catastrophic with destructive effects along the catchments and large morphological changes in coastal lagoons. High intensity rainfall (up to 200 mm in 2 h), the geomorphometry of the catchments and the massive construction of terraces and transverse walls are involved in the generation of catastrophic flood events. Additionally, the lagoons were altered considerably by human intervention for flood control and to allow for an increased amount of human activities within the surrounding areas, although the high recurrence of catastrophic flood events causes a persistent difficulty in the human battle to dominate these ecosystems. Therefore, the area occupied by lagoons increased between 1956 and the present time from 31,981 m(2) to 63,802 m(2) because of the high recurrence of catastrophic flood events. Furthermore, tourism demand and a social conservation consciousness have promoted restoration and preservation since the 1990s.

The event originated after heavy rainfall in the river simbach and caused five fatalities and severe damages on residential, non-residential properties and infrastructure. During this event the failure of a road dam and a lateral dyke lead to a sudden increase of the discharge within the town. On behalf of the bavarian environment agency this flash flood was investigated in order to evaluate the impact of these failures.

487,Li Z;Zhang H;Singh Vp;Yu R;Zhang S,"A simple early warning system for flash floods in an ungauged catchment and application in the loess plateau, china",WATER,"Under climate change, flash floods have become more frequent and severe, and are posing a danger to society, especially in the ungauged catchments. The objective of this paper, is to construct a simple and early warning system, serving for flash floods risk management in the ungauged catchments of the loess plateau in china, and offer a reference for flash flood warning in other areas in the world. Considering the absence of hydrological data in the ungauged catchments, the early warning system for flash floods is established by combining the regional or watershed isograms of hydrological parameters and local empirical formulas. Therein, rainfall and water stage/flow are used as warning indices for real-time risk estimation of flash flood. For early warning, the disaster water stage was first determined according to the protected objects (e.g., residents and buildings), namely the critical water stage. The critical flow (flow threshold), was calculated based on the water stage, and the established relationship between water stage and flow using the cross-sectional measured data. Then, according to the flow frequency curve of the design flood, the frequency of critical flow was ascertained. Assuming that the rainfall and the flood have the same frequency, the critical rainfall threshold was calculated through the design rainstorm with the same frequency of the design flood. Due to the critical rainfall threshold being sensitive with different soil conditions, the design flood and frequency curve of flood flow were calculated under different soil conditions, and thus the rainfall threshold was given under different soil condition for early warning of the flash flood disaster. Taking two sections in zichang county (within the loess plateau) as an example, we set the rainfall and water stage/flow thresholds to trigger immediate or preparation signals for the migration of the population along the river. The application of this method to the 7.26 flood events in 2017 in china, shows that the early warning system is feasible. It is expected that this simple early warning system can provide early warnings of flash floods in ungauged catchments in the loess plateau and other similar areas.",CRITICAL WATER STAGE; EARLY WARNING SYSTEM; FLASH FLOOD DISASTER; LOESS PLATEAU; RAINFALL THRESHOLD; UNGAUGED CATCHMENT,RAINFALL THRESHOLDS; SOIL-MOISTURE; PRECIPITATION; MODEL; STREAMFLOW,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,4,none,"ZHANG, HB (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHANGAN UNIV, SCH ENVIRONM SCI \& ENGN, XIAN 710054, SHAANXI, PEOPLES R CHINA.;ZHANG, HB (REPRINT AUTHOR), MINIST EDUC, KEY LAB SUBSURFACE HYDROL \& ECOL EFFECT ARID REG, XIAN 710054, SHAANXI, PEOPLES R CHINA.;LI, ZHEHAO, ZHANG, HONGBO, ZHANG, SHUQI, CHANGAN UNIV, SCH ENVIRONM SCI \& ENGN, XIAN 710054, SHAANXI, PEOPLES R CHINA.;ZHANG, HONGBO, MINIST EDUC, KEY LAB SUBSURFACE HYDROL \& ECOL EFFECT ARID REG, XIAN 710054, SHAANXI, PEOPLES R CHINA.;SINGH, VIJAY P., TEXAS A\&M UNIV, DEPT BIOL \& AGR ENGN, 400 BIZZELL ST, COLLEGE STN, TX 77843 USA.;SINGH, VIJAY P., TEXAS A\&M UNIV, ZACHRY DEPT CIVIL ENGN, 400 BIZZELL ST, COLLEGE STN, TX 77843 USA.;YU, RUIHONG, INNER MONGOLIA UNIV, COLL ENVIRONM \& RESOURCES, HOHHOT 010021, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.3390/W11030426,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,"NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [51379014, 51809005]; TECHNOLOGY FOUNDATION FOR SELECTED OVERSEAS CHINESE SCHOLARS, DEPARTMENT OF PERSONNEL IN SHAANXI PROVINCE OF CHINA [2017035]; WATER CONSERVANCY SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM OF SHAANXI PROVINCE OF CHINA [2018SLKJ-11]",,2073-4441,3,,MDPI,11,2019,ISI000464535600003,40,WATER RESOURCES,6,WATER RESOURCES,2016129027CHD.EDU.CN HBZHANGCHD.EDU.CN VSINGHTAMU.EDU RHYUIMU.EDU.CN JESSIEZHANGCHD.EDU.CN,,HT4LR,,"ZHANG, HB (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHANGAN UNIV, SCH ENVIRONM SCI \& ENGN, XIAN 710054, SHAANXI, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,CHANGAN UNIV;KEY LAB SUBSURFACE HYDROL AND ECOL EFFECT ARID REG;TEXAS AANDM UNIV;TEXAS AANDM UNIV;INNER MONGOLIA UNIV,CHANGAN UNIV,,"LI Z, 2019, WATER","LI Z, 2019, WATER",FALSE,1,6,0,2,0,0,1_5,0,2

Operational geostationary meteorological satellites have the capability to provide precipitation estimates and soil wetness indices at the global scale, while polar orbital satellites can provide the quantification of catchment physical characteristics, such as topography and land use, and catchment variables such as soil moisture and snow cover. There have been many demonstrations of the operational use of these satellites for detailed monitoring and mapping of floods and post-flood damage assessment. This paper addresses the use of earth observation satellites for flood managers, flash flood analysis and prediction, and the user community. A remote sensing management cycle is presented that involves: (1) prevention where history, corporate memory, and climatology are important, (2) mitigation that insulates people or infrastructure from hazards, (3) pre-flood which is the preparation and forecast stage where remote sensing is essential, (4) response (during the flood) where ``actions to be taken is of key importance and weather nowcasts (0 - 3 hour prediction of precipitation) using remote sensing is extremely useful, and (5) recovery (post flood) which is the post-mortern stage where damage assessment, procedures, and numerical weather prediction and hydrological models are validated.

A case study of integrated end-to-end climate-hydrology-water resources management in an operational environment, and another of flash flood prediction over large regions with very high resolution serve to highlight these issues. Transition from deterministic to probabilistic forecasting is advanced as necessary for improving forecast generation and use.

The method, designed to explore the link between crisis behavioral response and hydrometeorological dynamics, aims at understanding the spatial and temporal capacities and constraints on human behaviors in fast-evolving hydrometeorological conditions. It builds on methods coming from both geosciences and transportations studies to complement existing postflood field investigation methodology used by hydrometeorologists. The authors propose an interview framework, structured around a chronological guideline to allow people who experienced the flood firsthand to tell the stories of the circumstances in which their activities were affected during the flash flood.this paper applies the data collection method to the case of the 15 june 2010 flash flood event that killed 26 people in the draguignan area (var, france). As a first step, based on the collected narratives, an abductive approach allowed the identification of the possible factors influencing individual responses to flash floods. As a second step, behavioral responses were classified into categories of activities based on the respondents' narratives. Then, aspatial and temporal analysis of the sequences made of the categories of action to contextualize the set of coping responses with respect to local hydrometeorological conditions is proposed. During this event, the respondents mostly follow the pace of change in their local environmental conditions as the flash flood occurs, official flood anticipation being rather limited and based on a large-scale weather watch. Therefore, contextual factors appear as strongly influencing the individual's ability to cope with the event in such a situation.",SEVERE STORMS; COMMUNICATIONS; DECISION MAKING; EMERGENCY RESPONSE; FIELD EXPERIMENTS; FLOOD EVENTS; SOCIETAL IMPACTS,HUMAN-ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH; FLASH FLOODS; SOUTHERN FRANCE; SEPTEMBER 2002; EVENT; METHODOLOGY; SYSTEMS; CLIMATE; STORM,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,31,"BORGA M, 2011, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V14, P834, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2011.05.017.;BORGA M, 2008, HYDROL PROCESS, V22, P3883, DOI 10.1002/HYP.7111.;CETE, CAMP REL PHE ZON IN.;CLARK AF, 2010, TRANSPORTATION, V37, P165, DOI 10.1007/S11116-009-9225-9.;CREUTIN JD, 2013, J HYDROL, V482, P14, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2012.11.009.;CREUTIN JD, 2009, METEOROL APPL, V16, P115, DOI 10.1002/MET.128.;DELRIEU G, 2005, J HYDROMETEOROL, V6, P34, DOI 10.1175/JHM-400.1.;DOHERTY ST, 2000, TRANSPORTATION, V27, P75, DOI 10.1023/A:1005231926405.;DRABEK T.

Climate variability may also bring about precipitation events that cause floods. However, recent floods in most areas may be anthropogenically induced and are on a spatial and temporal increase. This study assessed rainfall variability, flooding and the adaptations of slum residents to floods in kumasi, ghana. Rainfall data of kumasi were collected from the meteorological services department, accra. Basic descriptive statistics of rainfall data were used to evaluate the rainfall variability. The mann-kendall test was used to assess rainfall trends. A survey of residents of flood-prone suburbs was conducted to assess their vulnerability and adaptations to floods. The results show that rainfall in march and november is significantly decreasing. The floods in kumasi are not due to climate change but bad spatial development practices. Most people will pump out water and build embankments around their houses as adaptations to the floods. Flooding in kumasi will continue to outwit local government initiatives of storm drain construction because the floods are predominantly due to development of effluent streams and less from flash floods.",URBANISATION; RAINFALL VARIABILITY; FLOODING; ADAPTATIONS; GHANA,CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; WATER; VULNERABILITY; COMMUNITIES; TRENDS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,8,"ADELEKAN IO, 2010, ENVIRON URBAN, V22, P433, DOI 10.1177/0956247810380141.;BARBE LE, 2002, J CLIMATOL, V15, P187.;BATISANI N, 2010, APPL GEOGR, V30, P483, DOI 10.1016/J.APGEOG.2009.10.007.;BOTCHIE G, 2007, ISSER TECHNICAL PUBL, V72, P78.;BRINSON MM., 1993, WRPDE4 ARM ENG WAT E.;BROOK RM, 2000, PERI URBAN INTERFACE, PVII + 251.;CAMPION BB, 2011, WETL ECOL MANAG, V19, P423, DOI 10.1007/S11273-011-9226-2.;CASANOVA MT, 2000, PLANT ECOL, V147, P237, DOI 10.1023/A:1009875226637.;CORNISH GA, 2003, WASTEWATER USE IRRIG.;DANSO G., 2006, CITIES FARMING FUTUR, P205.;DANSO G., 2002, URBAN AGR MAGAZINE, V7, P5.;DRECHSEL P, 2006, MAKING PLANNING WORK, P74.;FEDESKI M, 2007, LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN, V83, P50, DOI 10.1016/J.LANDURBPLAN.2007.05.012.;GILBERT R.

227,Gohar A;Kondolf Gm,Flash flooding as a threat to settlements even in remote areas,ENVIRONMENT AND URBANIZATION,"Desert environments are subject to flash floods in wadi floors, which may occur only once every decade or two in a given wadi (dry channels or valleys, except during rains). In areas of rapid growth, flood-prone areas can become urbanized in the time between floods. Being flat and constituted of sandy sediments, unlike the surrounding terrain, wadi floors are often used for construction, exposing the new settlements to flood risks. We present a case study of the town of el-sheikh el-shazli, in the eastern desert of egypt, which has undergone increasingly rapid development over the past two decades. The town is named for an important 13th-century sufi leader whose shrine receives thousands of visitors annually. We document the extent and effects of the last flash flood (1996) from interviews, field measurement of flood debris, and patterns in satellite imagery, these show the extent of new development in flood-prone wadi floors and the potential risks to residents and visitors in the absence of proper planning. We then recommend measures to reduce the future loss of life and damage from flooding.",EL-SHEIKH EL-SHAZLI; ENVIRONMENT; FLOODING; RED SEA; SUSTAINABILITY,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"ANDERSEN G L, 2007, THESIS.;COOLS J, 2012, EARLY WARNING SYSTEM.;FAROUK A, 2007, FLOOD RISK ANAL ELSH.;KONDOLF G M, TOOLS FLUVIAL GEOMOR.","GOHAR, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), 1070 JACKSON ST,APT 713, ALBANY, CA 94706 USA.;GOHAR, AMIR, KONDOLF, G.

In this study, we present the methodological approach that led to the submission and subsequent approval of the civil protection plan of navaluenga (central spain), in which the first phase was to analyse flood hazard by combining the hydrological modelling system (hec-hms) and the iber 2d hydrodynamic model. We then analysed social vulnerability and designed measures to put into practice within the framework of the civil protection plan. At a later phase, we assessed citizens' flash-flood risk perception and level of awareness regarding some key variables of the civil protection plan. To this end, 254 adults representing roughly 12\% of the population census were interviewed. Responses were analysed descriptively, comparing awareness regarding preparedness and response actions with the corresponding information and behaviours previously defined in the civil protection plan. In addition, we carried out a latent class cluster analysis aimed at identifying the different groups present among the interviewees. Our results showed that risk perception is low. Specifically, 60.8\% of the interviewees showed low risk perception and low awareness (cluster 1), 24.4\% had high risk perception and low awareness (cluster 2), while the remaining 14.8\% presented high long-term risk perception and high awareness (cluster 3). These findings suggest the need for integrating these key variables of social risk perception and local tailored information in emergency management plans, especially in urban areas prone to flash-floods where response times are limited.

270,Choudhury Ny;Paul A;Paul Bk,Impact of costal embankment on the flash flood in bangladesh: a case study,APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,"Coastal areas of bangladesh frequently experience tropical cyclones and associated tidal bore. In order to prevent cyclonic or storm-surge flooding and to increase crop production by preventing intrusion of saline ocean water, many coastal embankment projects were initiated in the 1960s by the bangladesh government. After construction of these embankments, particularly their reconstruction in 1991 has increased the frequency of flash floods in coastal areas. The objective of this study is to examine to what extent the reconstruction of embankment is responsible for the increased severity of flash flooding at the chokoria thana of the cox's bazar district, bangladesh. Using hydrological data and perception of the respondents on the increased flooding through the rapid rural appraisal (rra) method, it was found that severity of the flood increased after the reconstruction of embankments in 1991. Other causes of increased flooding is also explored. (C) 2004 elsevier ltd.

413,Oyerinde Gt;Lawin Ea;Odofin Aj,Farmers' responses to changing hydrological trends in the niger basin parts of benin,HYDROLOGY,"Sub-saharan africa is highly vulnerable to climate change given its low capacities of resilience to the enormous challenges climate change will pose. Research aimed at evaluating changes in hydrological trends and methods of adaptation was conducted in the niger basin parts of benin at the peak of the rainy season in the year 2012. Rainfall and river discharge were analyzed from 1950-2010 in order to generate patterns of changes in the region. Structured questionnaires were used to evaluate the perceptions of 14 farming communities on climate-related issues and their methods of adaptations. Mann-kendall and pettit trend analyses were conducted for rainfall and river discharge. The findings indicated that significant decreases characterized rainfall and river discharge in the period of study. Flash flood was considered the major challenge faced in the region according to more than 90\% of crop, animal, and fish farmers. Aside from that, decrease in water availability was identified as an additional challenge. Irrigation, diversification, water treatment, drainage, small dams, and dikes were reported as the common adaptation mechanisms in the catchments.

We studied the coastal change, flash flood and damages effects three months after super cyclone. A flash flood affected one slumurb in port-vila. We studied the main features of the flood and also the vulnerability of the residents. The tropical cyclone produced storm surges and extensive inundation on severals parts of the coasts. The maximum wave heights reached five meters. Washover deposits and testimonies were used to map the flooding. Coastal changes (washover and erosion shape) indicated the coastal morpho-sedimentary responses to extreme event.

273,Yu B;Ma Y;Wu Y,"Case study of a giant debris flow in the wenjia gully, sichuan province, china",NATURAL HAZARDS,"The debris flow, which was triggered in the wenjia gully on august 13, 2010, is an extreme example of mass movement events, which occurred after the wenchuan earthquake of may 12, 2008. This earthquake triggered in the wenjia gully the second largest co-seismic landslide, which can be classified as a rockslide-debris avalanche. A lot of loose sediments was deposited in the basin. In the main so called deposition area ii of this landslide, with a volume of 30 x 10(6) m(3), flash floods can easily trigger debris flows because of the steep bottom slope and the relative small grain sizes of the sediments. The largest debris flow of august 13, 2010 destroyed the most downstream dam in the catchment during a heavy rain storm.

This study documents the trend of flash floods affecting the town of Pozzuoli, located along the coastline of the Campi Flegrei volcanic area, during the 1970–2014 time period. An archive research together with the collection of data published on news websites and social media allowed understanding of the triggering and evolution mechanisms of flash floods in the area, as well as the most recurrent damages. Rainfall data collected by the rain gauge located within the Pozzuoli watershed were also analyzed. Results of this study show an increased frequency of flash flood events occurred in the study area. The variation in flash flood frequency is likely not related to urbanization changes, as no increase of the urban area occurred after the year 2000. The observed increase of flash flood events in recent years (2000–2014) can be reasonably ascribed to variations in the rainfall regime. Our research provides a contribution for the understanding of flash flood processes in the study area as well as relevant information for hazard and risk assessment.

To address these hazards, better coping, adaptation and resilience are needed. Cities all over the world suffer from heat and flood disasters that account for significant losses. This paper examines the incidence of heat and flood occurrence in urban areas, and examines how sustainable urban drainage systems (suds) is used to combat them. The methodology is based on historical event analysis, literature review and secondary data. Results indicate that heat and flood hazards in cities can be effectively reduced by using sud systems which incorporate vegetated surfaces that absorbs and retains rain water, purifies stormwater and transfers heat. Results show that sud system reduces flood peaks and heat, thereby reducing the incidence of flash floods and heat islands. Sud system is recommended as a viable method of heat and flood control in cities as cities using suds were found to cope very well with heat and floods. Overall, technical measures of flood management such as suds are found to be effective, affordable, aesthetically pleasing and socially acceptable. A holistic strategy combing technical sudss and non-technical human aspects of coping and resilience is the key towards effective management of floods in cities.",,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,none,"CHAN, NW (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV SAINS MALAYSIA, SCH HUMANITIES, GEORGE TOWN 11800, MALAYSIA.;CHAN, N.

The reason is twofold: on the one hand, climate change has increase rainfall frequency and intensity, while on the other, reckless urban expansion has increased exposure to such hazards over time. Italy is a country that is very vulnerable to flood and landslide hazard, the city of genoa, which, in recent decades, has been frequently hit by severe floods, has risen to symbolize italian geo-hydrological risk. Recent studies on genoa's geo-hydrological hazard have focused on the analysis of hydro-geomorphological features of the bisagno stream basin, yet their main focus was on hazard control. Very little research has been done to enhance the understanding of the source of risk in such catchments. This paper presents a study on the increased urban exposure and vulnerability to geo-hydrological hazard along the bisagno stream catchment area over the last 200 years. Morphometric analyses were coupled with historical documents showing the evolution of the urban layout in this area. The results show that the ``bisagno master plan, a territorial planning strategy aimed at reducing geo-hydrological hazard and risk, has not produced the expected benefits. In spite of the plan, critical changes in land use and the hydrographic network, along with uncontrolled anthropization of the genoa metropolitan area, has continued over the last two decades.",BISAGNO STREAM CATCHMENT AREA; GEO-HYDROLOGICAL HAZARD; URBAN SPRAWL; SOCIO-ECONOMIC VULNERABILITY; CITY OF GENOA; ITALY,FLOOD RISK-ASSESSMENT; INTEGRATED SIMULATION METHOD; FLASH-FLOOD; LAND-USE; LANDSLIDE RISK; AVALANCHE RISK; REGION; LIGURIA; CLASSIFICATION; PERCEPTION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"FACCINI, F (REPRINT AUTHOR), CNR, IRPI, I-10135 TURIN, ITALY.;FACCINI, F (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV GENOA, AMBIENTE \& VITA, DIPARTIMENTO SCI TERRA, I-16132 GENOA, ITALY.;PALIAGA, GUIDO, LUINO, FABIO, TURCONI, LAURA, FACCINI, FRANCESCO, CNR, IRPI, I-10135 TURIN, ITALY.;MARINCIONI, FAUSTO, UNIV POLITECN MARCHE, DIPARTIMENTO SCI VITA \& AMBIENTE, I-60131 ANCONA, ITALY.;FACCINI, FRANCESCO, UNIV GENOA, AMBIENTE \& VITA, DIPARTIMENTO SCI TERRA, I-16132 GENOA, ITALY.",10.3390/SU12031114,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,,,,3,,MDPI,12,2020,ISI000524899602001,68,"SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY",1,"GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES",GUIDO.PALIAGAIRPI.CNR.IT FABIO.LUINOIRPI.CNR.IT LAURA.TURCONIIRPI.CNR.IT F.MARINCIONIUNIVPM.IT FACCINIUNIGE.IT,,LB8SF,,"FACCINI, F (REPRINT AUTHOR), CNR, IRPI, I-10135 TURIN, ITALY",ISI,CNR;UNIV POLITECN MARCHE;UNIV GENOA,CNR,,"PALIAGA G, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY","PALIAGA G, 2020, SUSTAINABILITY",FALSE,1,4,2,0,0,0,1_8_13,0,5

The study site comprises the city of bari and the neighbouring towns, belonging to the same catchment basin, which is characterised by a low-relief karst very rich in natural cavities and dry valleys, the latter locally called lame. From the second half of the 1500s until today, in the whole area, short rainfall storms (lasting less than 6 h) with disastrous and mortal consequences have been recorded many times. In the last decades, human activities, such as urbanization, stone clearing for agricultural purposes, quarrying and deforestation induced severe changes in the karst landscape causing the modification of the surficial and underground drainage. In particular, an examination is made of the factors causing the complete destruction of the ``di maso park on the night between 22 and 23 october 2005, in consequence of a high-intensity rainfall (152.6 mm in a 6-h period) accompanied by flash flooding.

This paper takes the 2015 xuyong flash flood/debris flow event as a case study to examine the impacts of human activities on the occurrence and amplification of mountain flood hazards. Field investigations, the interpretation of observational data and mechanistic analyses are carried out as part of a comprehensive analysis of the processes by which mountain flood hazards develop and become amplified, the contribution of excessive sediment supplies to mountain flood hazards and the effects of human activities on mountain flood hazards. Results of this comprehensive analysis indicate that some human activities contribute to the occurrence of the initiation of mountain flood hazards. These human activities fall into two main categories: (1) deforestation and improper construction damage the natural environment and may increase the occurrence of mountain flood hazards, (2) improper choices of residences, local congestion of engineering structures and some other factors may directly amplify the losses caused by mountain flood hazards. Finally, some hazard prevention and mitigation measures for mountain flood hazards are discussed.",HUMAN ACTIVITIES; MOUNTAIN FLOOD HAZARDS; EXCESSIVE SEDIMENT SUPPLY; HAZARD PREVENTION AND MITIGATION; MONITORING AND FORECASTING,DEBRIS FLOWS; WATER CYCLE; RIVER-BASIN; RAINFALL; PRECIPITATION; LANDSLIDES; INITIATION; EMISSIONS; WARNINGS; PLATEAU,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"BAWA KS, 1997, NATURE, V386, P562, DOI 10.1038/386562A0.;BEZAK N, 2016, J HYDROL, V541, P272, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2016.02.058.;BORGA M, 2014, J HYDROL, V518, P194, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2014.05.022.;BUCHHOLZ T, 2017, ENERGY, V141, P483, DOI 10.1016/J.ENERGY.2017.09.062.;CALIANNO M, 2013, J HYDROL, V477, P1, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2012.09.036.;CAMARASA-BELMONTE AM, 2016, J HYDROL, V541, P99, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2016.03.019.;CATANE SG, 2012, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V169, P55, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2012.04.008.;CHEN NS, 2015, HOLOCENE, V25, P973, DOI 10.1177/0959683615574893.;CHEN XQ, 2015, ENG GEOL, V194, P73, DOI 10.1016/J.ENGGEO.2014.10.002.;CHIRICO GB, 1999, P EGS PLIN C MED STO, P473.;COX PM, 2000, NATURE, V408, P184, DOI 10.1038/35041539.;DEL MISTRO R, 2017, TRANSP RES PROC, V25, P3515, DOI 10.1016/J.TRPRO.2017.05.272.;FENG J, 2014, J HYDROL ENG, V19, P1101, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)HE.1943-5584.0000903.;GOLDBERG A, 2016, NATURE, V532, P232, DOI 10.1038/NATURE17176.;HELD IM, 2006, J CLIMATE, V19, P5686, DOI 10.1175/JCLI3990.1.;HUNTINGTON TG, 2006, J HYDROL, V319, P83, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2005.07.003.;IADANZA C, 2016, J HYDROL, V541, P230, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2016.01.018.;IMAIZUMI F, 2006, GEOPHYS RES LETT, V33, DOI 10.1029/2006GL026250.;IVERSON RM, 2000, WATER RESOUR RES, V36, P1897, DOI 10.1029/2000WR900090.;JIANG T, 2008, INT J CLIMATOL, V28, P1471, DOI 10.1002/JOC.1635.;JOHNSON KA, 1990, CAN GEOTECH J, V27, P789, DOI 10.1139/T90-092.;JOYE SB, 1993, MAR ECOL PROG SER, V94, P267, DOI 10.3354/MEPS094267.;LEAN J, 1989, NATURE, V342, P411, DOI 10.1038/342411A0.;LI R, 2012, SOIL RES, V50, P105, DOI 10.1071/SR11331.;MARCHI L, 2016, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V272, P68, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2015.11.005.;MAZZORANA B, 2012, J ENVIRON MANAGE, V94, P112, DOI 10.1016/J.JENVMAN.2011.06.030.;MCGUIRE LA, 2017, GEOPHYS RES LETT, V44, P7310, DOI 10.1002/2017GL074243.;MEINSHAUSEN M, 2009, NATURE, V458, P1158, DOI 10.1038/NATURE08017.;MIAO QH, 2016, J HYDROL, V541, P371, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2016.04.054.;MILLER FP, 2010, 1887 YELLOW RIVER FL.;MORSS RE, 2016, J HYDROL, V541, P649, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2015.11.047.;NAPOLITANO E, 2016, LANDSLIDES, V13, P967, DOI 10.1007/S10346-015-0647-5.;PENNA D, 2013, CLIMATE VULNERABILIT, P229.;PROCTER E, 2011, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V132, P41, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2011.04.035.;RUIZ-VILLANUEVA V, 2010, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V118, P383, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2010.02.006.;SALA M, 2003, GEOGR ANN A, V85A, P301, DOI 10.1111/J.0435-3676.2003.00207.X.;SEARCHINGER T, 2008, SCIENCE, V319, P1238, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.1151861.;SILVESTRO F, 2016, J HYDROL, V541, P50, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2015.08.004.;STANCANELLI LM, 2017, J HYDROL, V550, P130, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2017.04.038.;TANG C, 2011, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V11, P2903, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-11-2903-2011.;WANG GL, 2013, NAT HAZARDS, V69, P1835, DOI 10.1007/S11069-013-0772-1.;WILLMOTT CJ, 1985, J CLIMATOL, V5, P589, DOI 10.1002/JOC.3370050602.;YE HC, 1997, INT J CLIMATOL, V17, P155.;ZHOU P, 2008, CATENA, V75, P319, DOI 10.1016/J.CATENA.2008.07.010.","ZHOU, JW (REPRINT AUTHOR), SICHUAN UNIV, STATE KEY LAB HYDRAUL \& MT RIVER ENGN, CHENGDU, SICHUAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.;ZHOU, JW (REPRINT AUTHOR), SICHUAN UNIV, COLL WATER RESOURCE \& HYDROPOWER, CHENGDU, SICHUAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.;GAN, BIN-RUI, LIU, XING-NIAN, YANG, XING-GUO, WANG, XIE-KANG, ZHOU, JIA-WEN, SICHUAN UNIV, STATE KEY LAB HYDRAUL \& MT RIVER ENGN, CHENGDU, SICHUAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.;YANG, XING-GUO, ZHOU, JIA-WEN, SICHUAN UNIV, COLL WATER RESOURCE \& HYDROPOWER, CHENGDU, SICHUAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.1080/19475705.2018.1480539,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,1947-5705,1,816-840,TAYLOR \& FRANCIS LTD,9,2018,ISI000442683600004,44,"GEOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",3,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",JWZHOUSCU.EDU.CN,,GR5OB,,"ZHOU, JW (REPRINT AUTHOR), SICHUAN UNIV, STATE KEY LAB HYDRAUL \& MT RIVER ENGN, CHENGDU, SICHUAN, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,SICHUAN UNIV;SICHUAN UNIV,SICHUAN UNIV,,"GAN B, 2018, GEOMAT NAT HAZARDS RISK","GAN B, 2018, GEOMAT NAT HAZARDS RISK",TRUE,2,3,0,0,0,5_6,1_8_16,0,5

We assess the damage and societal impacts, as well as the atmospheric and hydrological drivers using documentary evidence, observations and novel numerical weather and runoff simulations. The greatest damage was concentrated close to the alpine divide and lago maggiore. An atmospheric reanalysis emphasizes the repeated occurrence of streamers of high potential vorticity as precursors of heavy precipitation. Dynamical downscaling indicates high freezing levels (4000ma. S.l.), extreme precipitation rates (max. 270mm24 h(-1)) and weather dynamics that agree well with observed precipitation and damage, and with existing concepts of forced low-level convergence, mid-level uplift and iterative northeastward propagation of convective cells. Simulated and observed peak levels of lago maggiore differ by 2 m, possibly because the exact cross section of the lake outflow is unknown. The extreme response of lago maggiore cannot be attributed to low forest cover. Nevertheless, such a paradigm was adopted by policy makers following the 1868 flood, and used to implement nationwide afforestation policies and hydraulic structures. These findings illustrate the potential of high-resolution, hydrometeorological models - strongly supported by histor-ical methods - to shed new light on weather events and their socio-economic implications in the 19th century.",,HEAVY PRECIPITATION; OROGRAPHIC PRECIPITATION; 20TH-CENTURY REANALYSIS; WEATHER PATTERNS; CLIMATE MODEL; FLASH FLOODS; SWISS FLOOD; ALPINE; TEMPERATURE; SENSITIVITY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"AMBROSETTI W., 1994, PIENA LAGO MAGGIORE.;ANDRES N, 2016, METEOROL APPL, V23, P448, DOI 10.1002/MET.1569.;[ANONYMOUS], 2002, HOCHW 2000 CRUES 200.;APPENZELLER C, 1992, NATURE, V358, P570, DOI 10.1038/358570A0.;ARPAGAUS J., 1870, HOCHWASSER JAHRES 18, V172.;BADOUX A, 2014, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V14, P279, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-14-279-2014.;BARTON Y, 2016, MON WEATHER REV, V144, P347, DOI 10.1175/MWR-D-15-0205.1.;BERTO A, 2004, METEOROL Z, V13, P189, DOI 10.1127/0941-2948/2004/0013-0189.;BLOTNITZKY L., 1869, BERICHT FOHN DESSEN.;BOGNI P., 1869, INONDAZIONE SESTO CA.;BORGA M, 2014, J HYDROL, V518, P194, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2014.05.022.;BOUDEVILLAIN B, 2009, METEOROLOGIE, V66, P18, DOI DOI 10.4267/2042/28828.;BOUGEAULT P, 2001, B AM METEOROL SOC, V82, P433, DOI 10.1175/1520-0477(2001)082<0433:TMSOP>2.3.CO,2.;BREUER L, 2003, ECOL MODEL, V169, P237, DOI 10.1016/S0304-3800(03)00274-6.;BRONNIMANN S., 2013, WEATHER EXTREMES 140, P53, DOI [10.4480/GB2013.G89.06, DOI 10.4480/GB2013.G89.06].;BUZZI A, 1998, MON WEATHER REV, V126, P2369, DOI 10.1175/1520-0493(1998)126<2369:NSOTPF>2.0.CO,2.;BUZZI A, 2000, METEOROL ATMOS PHYS, V72, P131, DOI 10.1007/S007030050011.;CAILLOUET L, 2016, CLIM PAST, V12, P635, DOI 10.5194/CP-12-635-2016.;CARRILLO CM, 2017, CLIM DYNAM, V49, P4217, DOI 10.1007/S00382-017-3569-1.;CASSANDRO CREMONINI R., 2001, CUAD INVESTIG GEOGRA, V27, P147.;COAZ J.

With no specific warning, a disaster of this magnitude was not anticipated, and everyone was taken by surprise. The incidence also coincided with the peak of the tourist season when pilgrims, tourists, and others from across the country and abroad had gathered in the region in large numbers. The incidence thus resulted in a major tragedy of recent times in which human death toll surpassed 4000. The disaster was a major setback for the economy of the state to which tourism and pilgrimage are major contributors. Burden on public exchequer was further exacerbated by tax waiver and assistance provided to disaster-affected population even on losses that are not generally covered by state disaster response fund (sdrf). Important lessons were however learned in managing this disaster, and these would go a long way in strengthening the disaster management system not only in uttarakhand but also elsewhere.",UTTARAKHAND; KEDARNATH; HIGHER HIMALAYA; MONSOON; LANDSLIDE; TOE EROSION; FLASH FLOOD; GLACIAL LAKE OUTBURST,KOTI-BANAL ARCHITECTURE; KEDARNATH DISASTER,ENGLISH,"ARTICLE, BOOK CHAPTER",INCOLLECTION,2,"ALLEN SK, 2016, LANDSLIDES, V13, P1479, DOI 10.1007/S10346-015-0584-3.;BANDYOPADHYAY S, 2014, CURR SCI INDIA, V107, P557.;CAG, 2010, REP COMPTR AUD GEN I.;CHATTORAJ S.

215,Banihabib Me;Arabi A,The impact of catchment management on emergency management of flash-flood,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT,"Flash floods cause damages and need emergency actions especially in urban areas. Flood forecasting and flood warning systems (fffwss) can be used for reducing flood damages and saving lives in areas vulnerable to flooding. However, researches are needed to evaluate the effect of urbanisation and the significance of implementing catchment-management plan (icmp) on fffws. This paper describes a framework proposed to assess the impact of icmp on expected lead time (elt) of flash-flood warning and it was applied for an urbanised steep catchment in an arid region, north of metropolitan city, tehran, iran. The model is well calibrated and validated before and after icmp by four observed floods. The results show that icmp reduces mainly flood risk only in low-return periods (about 30\%) than in high-return periods. Finally, this paper demonstrated the efficiency of icmp in increasing emergency time for evacuation from possible inundated areas except in extreme floods events.",FLOOD WARNING SYSTEMS; FWSS; EXPECTED LEAD TIME; ELT; FLASH FLOODS; CATCHMENT MANAGEMENT; TAJRISH CATCHMENT; HEC-HMS MODEL; FLOOD CONTROL,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"AL-RAWAS G.

218,Saint-Martin C;Fouchier C;Javelle P;Douvinet J;Vinet F,Assessing the exposure to floods to estimate the risk of flood-related damage in french mediterranean basins,3RD EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT (FLOODRISK 2016),"The dreadful floods of 1999, 2002 and 2003 in south of france have alerted public opinion on the need for a more efficient and a further generalized national flood-forecasting system. This is why in 2003 irstea and meteo-france have implemented a new warning method for flash floods, including on small watersheds, using radar rainfall data in real-time: the aiga method. This modelling method currently provides real-time information on the magnitude of floods, but doesn't take into account the elements at risk surrounding the river streams. Its benefit for crisis management is therefore limited as it doesn't give information on the actual flood risk. To improve the relevance of the aiga method, this paper shows the benefits of the combination of hydrological warnings with an exposure index, to be able to assess the risk of flood-related damage in real time. To complete this aim, this work presents an innovative and easily reproducible method to evaluate exposure to floods over large areas with simple land-use data. For validation purpose, a damage database has been implemented to test the relevance of both aiga warnings and exposure levels. A case study on the floods of the 3rd october 2015 is presented to test the effectiveness of the combination of hazard and exposure to assess the risk of flood-related damage. This combination seems to give an accurate overview of the streams at risk, where the most important amount of damage has been observed after the flood.",,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,1,"ANTOINE J.-M., 2001, ANN GEOGRAPHIE.;BLAIKIE P., 2014, RISK NATURAL HAZARDS.;BOLIN R, 1998, DISASTERS, V22, P21, DOI 10.1111/1467-7717.00073.;BREMOND P, 2013, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V13, P2493, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-13-2493-2013.;BELMONTE AMC, 2011, APPL GEOGR, V31, P136, DOI 10.1016/J.APGEOG.2010.03.003.;CANNON T., 2000, FLOODS, V1, P45.;CORVEY W.J, 2012, LREC.;COSANDEY C., 1990, REGIONALISATION HYDR, V191, P103.;COYLE DIANE, 2009, NEW TECHNOLOGIES EME.;CREMONINI R, 2010, 6 EUR C RAD MET HYDR.;DELRIEU G, 2005, J HYDROMETEOROL, V6, P34, DOI 10.1175/JHM-400.1.;DOWNTON MW, 2005, NAT HAZARDS, V35, P211, DOI 10.1007/S11069-004-4808-4.;FFSA, 2009, IMP CHANG CLIM AM TE.;HUET P, 2003, RETOUR EXPERIENCE CR, P133.;JAVELLE P., 2016, 3 EUR C FLOOD RISK M.;JAVELLE P, 2014, HYDROLOG SCI J, V59, P1390, DOI 10.1080/02626667.2014.923970.;JENKS GF, 1963, ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR, V53, P15, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-8306.1963.TB00429.X.;KRON W, 2002, P FLOOD DEF.;LAVABRE J., 2005, INGENIERIES EAT, P[3, 12].;LE BIHAN G, 9 HYM WORKSHOP2015.;LEWIS J., 1999, DEV DISASTER PRONE P, P224.;LUGERI N., 2006, EUR22525 EN EUR COMM.;NICHOLLS R.J., 1993, SYNTHESIS VULNERABIL.;PEDUZZI P, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P1149, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-1149-2009.;PIGEON P., 2012, PARADOXES URBANISATI.;PONS F., EXZECO GIS BASED MET.;PONS F., 2011, SIMHYDRO 20102011, P18.;RENARD F., 2015, GEOGR HELV, V70, P333.;RUIN I, 2008, J HYDROL, V361, P199, DOI DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDR0L.2008.07.044.;RUIN I, 2014, WEATHER CLIM SOC, V6, P135, DOI 10.1175/WCAS-D-13-00009.1.;SAATY TL, 1990, EUR J OPER RES, V48, P9, DOI 10.1016/0377-2217(90)90057-I.;SHIRLEY W.L., 2006, SOCIAL VULNERABILITY, P115.;SOTO D., 2014, INFORSID.;UNITED NATIONS OFFICE FOR DISASTER RISK REDUCTION (UNISDR), 2015, P 3 UN WORLD C DIS R.;VALY J, 2010, CROISSANCE URBAINE R.;VARNES DJ, 1984, LANDSLIDE HAZARD ZON.;WENG P., 2002, BRGMRP51718FR.;WESTRELIN S., 2012, P EUR C RAD MET HYDR.","SAINT-MARTIN, C (REPRINT AUTHOR), IRSTEA AIX EN PROVENCE, 3275 ROUTE CEZANNE, F-13100 AIX EN PROVENCE, FRANCE.;SAINT-MARTIN, CLOTILDE, FOUCHIER, CATHERINE, JAVELLE, PIERRE, IRSTEA AIX EN PROVENCE, 3275 ROUTE CEZANNE, F-13100 AIX EN PROVENCE, FRANCE.;DOUVINET, JOHNNY, UNIV AVIGNON, UMR ESPACE CNRS 7300, 74 RUE LOUIS PASTEUR,CASE 19, F-84000 AVIGNON, FRANCE.;VINET, FREDDY, UNIV MONTPELLIER, UMR GRED, ROUTE MENDE, F-34199 MONTPELLIER 5, FRANCE.",10.1051/E3SCONF/20160704013,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE","LANG, M AND KLIJN, F AND SAMUELS, P",,,2267-1242,,,E D P SCIENCES,7,2016,ISI000392270100053,38,"ENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, GEOLOGY, PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, WATER RESOURCES",7,"ENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL, ENGINEERING, CIVIL, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, REGIONAL \& URBAN PLANNING, WATER RESOURCES",CLOTILDE.SAINT-MARTINIRSTEA.FR,E3S WEB OF CONFERENCES,BG8GU,3RD EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT (FLOODRISK 2016),"SAINT-MARTIN, C (REPRINT AUTHOR), IRSTEA AIX EN PROVENCE, 3275 ROUTE CEZANNE, F-13100 AIX EN PROVENCE, FRANCE",ISI,UNIV AVIGNON;UNIV MONTPELLIER,NOTREPORTED,,"SAINT-MARTIN C, 2016, 3RD EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT (FLOODRISK 2016)","SAINT-MARTIN C, 2016, 3RD EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT (FLOODRISK 2016)",FALSE,2,3,0,2,0,6,1_9,0,2

The resulted disruption even in small flood events may impose indirect damages which needs to be quantified to better manage traffic flows. In this paper, a framework was developed to address the vulnerability of transportation networks to pluvial and coastal flooding based on a state-of-the-art depth-disruption function which estimates flood depth impact on vehicle's speed reduction. In this framework, the flood depth was modeled using a static and hydrodynamic model and then assigned to each road segment. By turning flood depth into factors causing increase in travel time, the service area of four emergency services were calculated and the effect of coastal and pluvial flooding on road networks were discussed. The lower manhattan in new york city was selected as a case study. Results show that this framework provides better insights into determining critical road segments and subsequently traffic management during flooding events.",ROAD NETWORK; PLUVIAL FLOODS; COASTAL FLOODING; BINARY ASSUMPTION; DEPTH-DISRUPTION FUNCTION; VULNERABILITY; SERVICE AREA,ROAD NETWORK; FLASH-FLOOD; VULNERABILITY; RAINFALL; IMPACT; LINKS,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,"BALIJEPALLI C, 2014, J TRANSP GEOGR, V39, P145, DOI 10.1016/J.JTRANGEO.2014.06.025.;BATES P., 2013, LISFLOOD FP USER MAN.;BERDICA K., 2002, TRANSPORT POLICY, V9, P117, DOI DOI 10.1016/S0967-070X(02)00011-2.;BONNIN GM, 2006, NOAA ATLAS, V14, P1.;BOWMAN M.J., 2005, HYDROLOGIC FEASIBILI.;CHEN XZ, 2015, TRANSPORT RES REC, P37, DOI 10.3141/2532-05.;D'ESTE GM, 2003, NETWORK RELIABILITY OF TRANSPORT, PROCEEDINGS, P23, DOI 10.1016/B978-008044109-2/50003-3.;FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY (FEMA), 2013, PREL FLOOD INS, V1.;GALLIEN TW, 2016, COAST ENG, V111, P95, DOI 10.1016/J.COASTALENG.2016.01.014.;KHADEMI N, 2015, INT J DISAST RISK RE, V12, P234, DOI 10.1016/J.IJDRR.2015.01.009.;KURAUCHI F, 2009, TRANSPORTATION AND TRAFFIC THEORY 2009: GOLDEN JUBILEE, P637, DOI 10.1007/978-1-4419-0820-9\_31.;MELILLO J.

Such changes are due to the demands of development which significantly change stormwater flow and constructed drainage systems. Problems relating to the present stormwater program have been identified, one of the major environmental effects, as a result of improper stormwater management, is flash floods. Hence, this study focuses on the benefits of landscape approach via the use of low-impact development strategies combined with soft landscape engineering in solving flash flood issues. Section 13, shah alam, malaysia was chosen as the study area as it has experienced serious flash flood problems for many years. Regardless of several solutions, the situation remains the same due to the current water peak runoff which has drastically increased since 2003 as a result of 34.8\% development. This site was also selected due to its rapid development. For these reasons, its current situation was observed and studied. The management of public spaces have been identified as the key factors in improving the current water peak runoff problems. Therefore, design solutions have been proposed for the study area in which the estimation of water peak runoff can be reduced by 7.9\%, which is equal to 81.77 m3/h.

The system uses rainfall intensity data from terrestrial microwave communication links and the geostationary meteosat second generation satellite, i.e., two systems that are already in place and operational. Flash flood early warnings are based on a combination of the flash flood guidance method and a hydrological model. The system will be maintained and operated through a public-private partnership, which includes a mobile telephone operator, a national meteorological service and an emergency relief service. The mobile telephone operator acts as both the supplier of raw input data and the disseminator of early warnings. The early warning system could significantly reduce the number of fatalities due to flash floods, improve the efficiency of disaster risk reduction efforts and play an important role in strengthening the resilience to climate change of developing countries in africa.

13,Creutin Jd;Borga M;Gruntfest E;Lutoff C;Zoccatelli D;Ruin I,A space and time framework for analyzing human anticipation of flash floods,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"We propose a new simplified vision of flood dynamics through temporal and spatial scales to enhance understanding of potential and limits of human responses to flash floods. Based on data from a set of extreme flash floods that occurred in europe, we analyze both the runoff response time of flash floods and the asynchronous character of flood peak time generation. We introduce the concept of ``timeliness to quantify the balance in time between the hydrological response of catchments to heavy storms and the human reactions. Timeliness is investigated across the range of spatial scales of concern for flash floods and for various types of anticipation actions. Results are reported for four extreme flash flood events occurred since 2002 in france, italy and slovenia. These results indicate that human actions adapt their pace to the physical context and are in a kind of ``hurrying process as the flood danger approaches in time. They show the importance of self-organization and `unofficial' warning in response to flash flooding by individuals and groups. The work draws on flood hazard research findings from hydrology, meteorology and social science and put forward a framework for interdisciplinary collaboration between hydrologists and social scientists.

251,Atta-Ur-Rahman Aur;Shaw R,Flood risk and reduction approaches in pakistan,DISASTER RISK REDUCTION APPROACHES IN PAKISTAN,"Globally, flood is a recurrently occurring damaging phenomenon. In terms of flood related damages, approximately 90 \% is reported from the developing countries, where poverty is a major risk factor and holding low resilience. Pakistan has no exception to it, where flood is a frequently occurring adverse event. Pakistan is one of the flood prone countries in the world because of its physical and climatic characteristics. The indus plain is occupied by more than 120 million population, where agriculture is a major source of livelihood earnings. Majority of them are poor section of the society and tenant cultivators. During the span of 67 years (1947-2013), on average of 4-year, a severe flood hit the country. The increasing population, degradation of ecological environment and the changing climate scenario have further multiplied the risk of flood disasters. It has been estimated that pakistan is suffering from frequent flood disasters and so far 11,239 human lives were lost, out which 1,985 is reported from the super-flood of 2010. It was a century worst flood, where 20 million people were affected and over 100,000 km 2 (1/5th of the country total area) inundated and approximate to us\$ 10 billion economic loss was registered. Since the inception of pakistan 1947, efforts have been made for building resilience through various flood reduction approaches. The existing flood reduction strategies range from structural to non-structural measures. This chapter provides a review of risks associated with flash and river flooding in pakistan. It also gives an analytical discussion on the historic flood events and their adverse impacts.

In this paper, we discuss changes in flood hazard and flood risk in china. First, we review published results (including our own works) on change detection in observed records of intense precipitation, high river flow and flood damage in china. We provide information on essential features of extreme floods in last decades - floods on large rivers, urban floods, and flash floods. Next, we review available projections for the future (including our own results), related to intense precipitation, high river flow and flood damage in china. We try to interpret the difference in flood hazard projections obtained in various publications. Since the spread of river flood hazard projections is large, projections have to be interpreted with caution, because of the impact on decisions related to climate change adaptation, flood risk reduction, and water resources management. We review flood risk reduction strategies in china, focusing on the present situation and division of responsibilities. China has embarked upon an ambitious and vigorous task to improve flood preparedness, by both structural (hard) defences, such as: dikes, dams and flood control reservoirs, and diversions, as well as non-structural (soft) measures: spatial planning and zoning, watershed management (source control), flood forecasting and warning systems, and awareness raising. The strategy of flood mitigation includes flood retention and urban water management to alleviate the burden of flash and urban flooding.",FLOOD RISK; FLOOD HAZARD; FLOOD RISK REDUCTION; FLOOD DEFENSES; NON-STRUCTURAL MEASURES,YANGTZE-RIVER BASIN; ASIAN SUMMER MONSOON; PRECIPITATION EXTREMES; GLOBAL PROJECTIONS; EASTERN CHINA; CLIMATE; ENSO; VULNERABILITY; TRENDS; RAINFALL,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,none,"KUNDZEWICZ, ZW (REPRINT AUTHOR), NUIST, SCH GEOG SCI, COLLABORAT INNOVAT CTR FORECAST \& EVALUAT METEORO, NANJING, JIANGSU, PEOPLES R CHINA.;JIANG, T (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHINA METEOROL ADM, NATL CLIMATE CTR, BEIJING, PEOPLES R CHINA.;KUNDZEWICZ, Z.

19,Ruin I;Creutin Jd;Anquetin S;Lutoff C,Human exposure to flash floods - relation between flood parameters and human vulnerability during a storm of september 2002 in southern france,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The aim of this paper is to investigate the detailed hydrometeorological circumstances that lead to accidental casualties, and to better understand the prominent physical factors of risk. Based on an event that affected the gard region (southern france) in september 2002, it is a first attempt to combine analysis of the physical and human response to mediterranean storms. After details concerning the methodology (for meteorological, hydrological and casualty analysis), the local context and the event, the authors examine two points: the dynamics of the event (flash-flood and riverine-flood response to the storm) together with human exposure on the one hand, and scale as a critical problem affecting flood risk on the other. This investigation stresses the specificity of small catchments, which are more dangerous both in hydrological and human terms. Moreover, this contribution linking social sciences and geophysics constitutes an important step in what [morss, r.e., wilhelmi, o.v., downton, m.w., gruntfest, e., 2005.

33,Kala Cp,"Deluge, disaster and development in uttarakhand himalayan region of india: challenges and lessons for disaster management",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,"The himalaya has been venerated by communities since antiquity and hence visited by a large number of pilgrims for paying tribute, annually. Uttarakhand state in the indian himalaya being the place of major hindu shrines like badrinath, kedarnath, gangotri and yamunotri and also the place of origin of many sacred rivers including the ganges, at present, is best known for the religious tourism. Though, the state population is about 10 million, over 25 million tourists visited here in 2011 despite the fact that the state remains under frequent natural hazards in the forms of landslides, earthquakes and flash roods mainly during monsoon. Recently, on 16 and 17 june 2013, the torrential downpour and subsequent flooding had wreaked havoc that not only swallowed vast swathes of uttarakhand but also took life of thousands of pilgrims and tourists. The cloudburst, heavy rainfall and subsequent landslides are the natural disasters but this disaster in uttarakhand is mainly attributed by masses as a man-made disaster due to unregulated tourism and unplanned construction. In this background, the major aim of this study is to explore and review the factors responsible for increased intensity and scale of disaster due to flash floods in the uttarakhand state of india. The paper also reviews and discusses various options for disaster risk reductions in the sensitive ecosystem such as the himalaya. (C) 2014 elsevier ltd.

This paper aims to focus on the flash flood disaster scenario of uttarakhand, a newly created himalayan state in india, on the basis of their severity and mechanism so that management efforts can be mounted by the disaster managers. Design/methodology/approach besides compiling the hazard- and risk-related work done by the various research institutions and universities the paper attempts to understand the mechanism responsible for this natural hazard. Findings uttrakhand is a state highly prone to disasters. Flash floods are disasters that are seasonal in nature and strike during a certain period of the year in certain pockets of the state with high frequency. Research limitations/implications the analysis is based on observations made in the entire state. Practical implications awareness amongst the masses regarding the flash flood disaster that is likely to affect them and their life support strategy is a must for bringing forth voluntary adoption of the safety norms.

231,Jing F;Yang Lz;Peng Yl;Wang Y;Zhang X;Zhang Dr,Enhancing the effectiveness of flood road gauges with color coding,NATURAL HAZARDS,"Recent years have witnessed many drowning tragedies on roads, even where flood gauges were equipped to warn drivers about the depth of the flood water. The effectiveness of traditional flood gauges using the digit representation has been questioned. According to the attention-knowledge-compliance three-stage model, we propose that color coding can improve the effect of flood gauges. The present study compared the performance of a prototypical color flood gauge with two types of digit flood gauges in four experiments. Our results revealed a general advantage of color flood gauges over digit flood gauges in all testing conditions (with or without reflection and dynamic or static observation), which was manifested in both a sample of people lacking driving experience and a sample of experienced drivers. Specifically, the mean accuracy of color gauge conditions in the four experiments increased by at least 16\%, and the mean response time to the color gauge was shortened by at least 0.8 s compared with the digit gauge.

In this study, we employed the spatiotemporal analysis method to measure the spatial-temporal distribution of flash floods and examined the relationship between flash floods and driving factors in different subregions of landcover. Furthermore, we analyzed the response of flash floods on the economic development by sensitivity analysis. The results indicated that the number of flash floods occurring annually increased gradually from 1949 to 2015, and regions with a high quantity of flash floods were concentrated in zhaotong, qujing, kunming, yuxi, chuxiong, dali, and baoshan. Specifically, precipitation and elevation had a more significant effect on flash floods in the settlement than in other subregions, with a high r (pearson's correlation coefficient) value of 0.675, 0.674, 0.593, 0.519, and 0.395 for the 10 min precipitation in 20-year return period, elevation, 60 min precipitation in 20-year return period, 24 h precipitation in 20-year return period, and 6 h precipitation in 20-year return period, respectively. The sensitivity analysis showed that the kunming had the highest sensitivity (s=21.86) during 2000-2005. Based on the research results, we should focus on heavy precipitation events for flash flood prevention and forecasting in the short term, but human activities and ecosystem vulnerability should be controlled over the long term.",FLASH FLOOD; DRIVING FACTOR; SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS; SUBREGION OF LANDCOVER; YUNNAN PROVINCE,GRAIN PRODUCTION; RISK-ASSESSMENT; CHINA; PREDICTION; VULNERABILITY; HAZARD; DISASTERS; SYSTEM,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,4,none,"CHENG, WM (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHINESE ACAD SCI, STATE KEY LAB RESOURCES \& ENVIRONM INFORMAT SYST, INST GEOG SCI \& NAT RESOURCES RES, BEIJING 100101, PEOPLES R CHINA.;XIONG, JUNNAN, YE, CHONGCHONG, SOUTHWEST PETR UNIV, SCH CIVIL ENGN \& ARCHITECTURE, CHENGDU 610500, SICHUAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.;CHENG, WEIMING, ZHOU, CHENGHU, CHINESE ACAD SCI, STATE KEY LAB RESOURCES \& ENVIRONM INFORMAT SYST, INST GEOG SCI \& NAT RESOURCES RES, BEIJING 100101, PEOPLES R CHINA.;GUO, LIANG, ZHANG, XIAOLEI, CHINA INST WATER RESOURCES \& HYDROPOWER RES, BEIJING 100038, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.3390/SU11102926,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,STRATEGIC PRIORITY RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINESE ACADEMY OF SCIENCES [XDA20030302]; CHINA GEOLOGICAL SURVEY PROJECTCHINA GEOLOGICAL SURVEY [DD20190637]; OPEN SUBJECT OF BIG DATA INSTITUTE OF DIGITAL NATURAL DISASTER MONITORING IN FUJIAN [NDMBD2018003]; SOUTHWEST PETROLEUM UNIVERSITY OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION TEAM PROJECTS [2017CXTD09]; NATIONAL FLASH FLOOD INVESTIGATION AND EVALUATION PROJECT [SHZH-IWHR-57],,2071-1050,10,,MDPI,11,2019,ISI000471010300209,66,"SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY",19,"GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES",NEU\_XJN163.COM YECHONGCHONG107319163.COM CHENGWMLREIS.AC.CN GUOLIWHR.COM ZHOUCHLREIS.AC.CN ZHANGXLIWHR.COM,,IC5LV,,"CHENG, WM (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHINESE ACAD SCI, STATE KEY LAB RESOURCES \& ENVIRONM INFORMAT SYST, INST GEOG SCI \& NAT RESOURCES RES, BEIJING 100101, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,SOUTHWEST PETR UNIV;INST GEOG SCI AND NAT RESOURCES RES;CHINA INST WATER RESOURCES AND HYDROPOWER RES,INST GEOG SCI AND NAT RESOURCES RES,,"XIONG J, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY","XIONG J, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0,2,11_13,1,2
2,Bergholt D;Lujala P,"Climate-related natural disasters, economic growth, and armed civil conflict",JOURNAL OF PEACE RESEARCH,"Global warming is expected to make the climate warmer, wetter, and wilder. It is predicted that such climate change will increase the severity and frequency of climate-related disasters like flash floods, surges, cyclones, and severe storms. This article uses econometric methods to study the consequences of climate-induced natural disasters on economic growth, and how these disasters are linked to the onset of armed civil conflict either directly or via their impact on economic growth. The results show that climate-related natural disasters have a negative effect on growth and that the impact is considerable. The analysis of conflict onset shows that climate-related natural disasters do not increase the risk of armed conflict. This is also true when we instrument the change in gdp growth by climatic disasters. The result is robust to inclusion of country and time fixed effects, different estimation techniques, and various operationalization of the disasters measure, as well as for conflict incidence and war onset. These findings have two major implications: if climate change increases the frequency or makes weather-related natural disasters more severe, it is an economic concern for countries susceptible to these types of hazards. However, our results suggest - based on historical data - that more frequent and severe climate-related disasters will not lead to more armed conflicts through their effects on gdp growth.",ARMED CIVIL CONFLICT; CLIMATE CHANGE; CLIMATE-RELATED NATURAL DISASTERS; ECONOMIC GROWTH,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA; WAR; SHOCKS; BLAME; RISK,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,74,"ADANO WR, 2012, J PEACE RES, V49, P65, DOI 10.1177/0022343311427344.;ANDERSEN LE, 2002, DYNAMICS DEFORESTATI.;ARELLANO M, 1991, REV ECON STUD, V58, P277, DOI 10.2307/2297968.;ARELLANO M, 1995, J ECONOMETRICS, V68, P29, DOI 10.1016/0304-4076(94)01642-D.;BARRO R.

In order to do so, we estimated a difference-in-differences model that explicitly allows for the existence of spatial interactions within affected and unaffected regions. Our results show that municipalities directly affected by the flood suffered an 7.6\% decrease in gdp per capita in the year of the disaster. Three years after the flood, however, gdp per capita rebounded back to pre-disaster levels in all sectors but the agricultural sector.

There have been no major disasters in the history of ladakh, and no surveys on post-disaster psychiatric disorders have been conducted in this area. Aims and methods: to examine the impact of this disaster in ladakh one month post-disaster, we visited choglamsar, located near the town of leh, where the flood had the most severe impact. In total, 318 survivors (mean age: 58.6 years, female-male ratio: 59.7\%, tibetan refugees: 86.2\%) participated in the survey. We used the two-item patient health questionnaire (phq-2) along with questions covering background characteristics and disaster exposure. A psychiatrist interviewed the survivors with a single or double positive score in the phq-2 or with post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) symptoms. Results and conclusion: there were only two ptsd cases and five of major depressive disorders. Ptsd and depression were less common in the tibetan cultural areas than in other areas. The social background and temperamental characteristics of the tibetan culture may play a suppressive role in psychiatric disorders.",DISASTER; DEPRESSION; POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER; TIBETAN; LADAKHI,TORTURE; DEPRESSION; REFUGEES; TRAUMA; PTSD,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,5,"AMERICAN PSYCHIATRIC ASSOCIATION, 2002, DIAGN STAT MAN PSYCH.;BLAZER DG, 1998, PSYCHOL MED, V28, P1311, DOI 10.1017/S0033291798007648.;CHEUNG P, 1994, INT J SOC PSYCHIATRY, V40, P17, DOI 10.1177/002076409404000102.;EVANS M., 2000, ADV PSYCHIAT TREAT, V6, P49, DOI DOI 10.1192/APT.6.1.49.;HOLTZ TH, 1998, J NERV MENT DIS, V186, P24, DOI 10.1097/00005053-199801000-00005.;JOHNSON H, 2008, CLIN PSYCHOL REV, V28, P36, DOI 10.1016/J.CPR.2007.01.017.;KILIC C, 2003, ACTA PSYCHIAT SCAND, V108, P232, DOI 10.1034/J.1600-0447.2003.00119.X.;LEE INSOOK, 2003, TAEHAN KANHO HAKHOE CHI, V33, P829.;MAHONEY J, 1994, J AM GERIATR SOC, V42, P1006.;MARSELLA A.

67,Baig Sa;Xu X;Khan R,Microbial water quality risks to public health: potable water assessment for a flood-affected town in northern pakistan,RURAL AND REMOTE HEALTH,"Introduction: in mid-july 2010 flash flooding in pakistan destroyed the basic water, environmental sanitation and livelihood infrastructures in 82 districts. Two months later, the local press of swat (northern pakistan) reported that several residents of marghazar town became ill and were hospitalized after drinking contaminated water. A non-governmental organization (oxfam gb) team took action to determine the causes of this incident and analyzed the community drinking water supply. Methods: standard methods were used to analyze six physio-chemical and four microbiological water quality parameters at five selected sampling locations in the water supply system. Results: the samples from sites numbers (sn) 02, 03, 04 and 05 were found to be microbiologically unfit for drinking due to the presence of escherichia coli, shigella, salmonella and staphylococcus aureus (range 18-96 +/- 14 cfu/100 ml). However, the ph, conductivity, total dissolved solid, total hardness as calcium carbonate and nitrate as no3-2 of all the samples were within who permissible limits. Higher turbidities were recorded at sn04 and 05 of 6 +/- 0.23 and 9 +/- 1.23, respectively. Conclusion: quantitative results revealed the presence of pathogenic organisms and water quality risk factors due to the damaged water and environmental sanitation infrastructure. Continued water quality monitoring, the application of household based disinfectants, and healthy domestic hygiene practices are highly recommended in similar circumstances.",DOMESTIC HYGIENE; ESCHERICHIA COLI; MICROBIOLOGICAL TESTING; SALMONELLA; SHIGELLA; STAPHYLOCOCCUS AUREUS; WATER CONTAMINATION,DRINKING-WATER,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,16,"AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION, 1992, STANDARD METHODS EXA.;AMIN MT, 2009, DESALINATION, V248, P436, DOI 10.1016/J.DESAL.2008.05.085.;ASHBOLT NJ, 2004, TOXICOLOGY, V198, P229, DOI 10.1016/J.TOX.2004.01.030.;BAIG SA, 2011, ECOL ENG, V37, P1842, DOI 10.1016/J.ECOLENG.2011.06.011.;DUKE W F, 2006, RURAL REMOTE HEALTH, V6, P570.;EDBERG SC, 2000, J APPL MICROBIOL, V88, P106S, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-2672.2000.TB05338.X.;FEWTRELL L, 2001, WATER QUALITY GUIDEL.;GOVERNMENT OF PAKISTAN, 2006, NAT WAT QUAL REP.;MAHMOOD Q, 2011, DESALINATION, V273, P316, DOI 10.1016/J.DESAL.2011.01.052.;PAYMENT P, 1997, INT J ENVIRON HEAL R, V7, P5, DOI 10.1080/09603129773977.;SHAMS AB, 2012, J APPL SCI ENV SANIT, V1, P49.;UNITED NATIONS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, 2009, 5 YEARS LAT TSUN AFF.;WHELAN JJ, 2006, RURAL REMOTE HEALTH, V7, P627.;WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, 2003, EM ISS WAT INF DIS.;WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, 2004, GUID DRINK WAT QUAL, V1.","BAIG, SA (REPRINT AUTHOR), ZHEJIANG UNIV, DEPT ENVIRONM ENGN, COLL ENVIRONM \& RESOURCE SCI, HANGZHOU 310003, ZHEJIANG, PEOPLES R CHINA.;BAIG, S.

The analysis shows major differences in the total number of disaster events included in the databases (emdat=36, s2id=4,070) and estimated costs of loss and damage (em-dat - r\$ 9.2 billion, s2id - r\$ 331.4 billion). The analysis also shows that the five states most affected by these events are santa catarina, rio grande do sul, minas gerais, sao paulo and parana in brazil's south and southeast regions and that these results are consistent with the findings of other studies. The costs of disasters were highest for housing, public infrastructure works, collectively used public facilities, other public service facilities, and state health and education facilities. The costs associated with public health facilities were also high. Despite their limitations, both databases demonstrated their usefulness for determining seasonal and long-term trends and patterns, and risk areas, and thus assist decision makers in identifying areas that are most affected by and vulnerable to natural disasters.",NATURAL DISASTERS; HYDROMETEOROLOGICAL DISASTER; FLOODING; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT; DATABASE,DISASTERS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"[ANONYMOUS], INT DIS DAT.;BANCO CENTRAL DO BRASIL, TAX DE CAMB.;BRASIL.

The selected events are related to the occurrence of floods, flash floods, hail, snow/frost, tornados, windstorms, heat waves and lightning with adverse consequences (excluding those related to agriculture). The database includes, among others, the geographical distribution of the recorded events, relevant meteorological data, a brief description of the induced impacts and references in the press. This paper further offers an extensive analysis of the temporal and spatial distribution of high-impact weather events for the period 2001-2011, taking into account the intensity of weather conditions and the consequent impact on the society. Analysis of the monthly distribution of high-impact weather events showed that they are more frequent during october and november. More than 80 people lost their lives, half of which due to flash floods. In what concerns the spatial distribution of high-impact weather events, among the 51 prefectures of the country, attica, thessaloniki, elia and halkidiki were the most frequently affected areas, mainly by flash floods. Significant was also the share of tornados in elia, of windstorms in attica, of lightning and hail events in halkidiki and of snow/frost events in thessaloniki.",,LIGHTNING ACTIVITY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,49,"AMARO J, 2010, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V10, P2643, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-10-2643-2010.;BELOW R., 2009, DISASTER CATEGORY CL.;DOTZEK N, 2009, ATMOS RES, V93, P575, DOI 10.1016/J.ATMOSRES.2008.10.020.;EASTERLING DR, 2000, B AM METEOROL SOC, V81, P417, DOI 10.1175/1520-0477(2000)081<0417:OVATIE>2.3.CO,2.;FLOROS I., 2009, THESIS NATL TU ATHEN.;GANOULIS J., 2003, INT J RIVER BASIN MA, V1, P41, DOI [DOI 10.1080/15715124.2003.9635191, 10.1080/15715124.2003.9635191].;IPCC, 2012, MAN RISKS EXTR EV DI.;KANDILIOTI G, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V61, P441, DOI 10.1007/S11069-011-9930-5.;KATSANOS D, 2007, ATMOS RES, V83, P55, DOI 10.1016/J.ATMOSRES.2006.01.012.;KOTRONI V, 2011, ATMOS RES, V100, P1, DOI 10.1016/J.ATMOSRES.2010.12.007.;KRON W, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P535, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-535-2012.;LAGOUVARDOS K, 2007, Q J ROY METEOR SOC, V133, P1519, DOI 10.1002/QJ.121.;LAGOUVARDOS K, 1996, J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS, V101, P26217, DOI 10.1029/96JD01385.;LASTORIA B., 2006, ADV GEOSCI, V7, P223, DOI DOI 10.5194/ADGE0-7-223-2006.;LLASAT MC, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P2049, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-2049-2009.;LLASAT MC, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P1201, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-1201-2009.;LLASAT M.

291,He B;Huang X;Ma M;Chang Q;Tu Y;Li Q;Zhang K;Hong Y,Analysis of flash flood disaster characteristics in china from 2011 to 2015,NATURAL HAZARDS,"Flash floods are one of the most disastrous natural hazards and cause serious loss of life and economic damage every year. Flooding frequently affects many regions in china, including periodically catastrophic events. An extensive compilation of the available data has been conducted across various hydroclimatological regions to analyze the spatiotemporal characteristics of flash floods in china. This inventory includes over 782 documented events and is the first step toward establishing an atlas of extreme flash flood occurrences in china. This paper first presents the data compilation strategy, details of the database contents, and the typical examples of first-hand analysis results. The subsequent analysis indicates that the most extreme flash floods originate mainly from small catchments over complex terrains and results in dominantly small- and medium-sized flooding events in terms of scales, however, these events, abrupt and seasonally recurrent in nature, account for a large proportion of the overall flooding-related disasters, especially disproportionately affecting elderly and youth populations. Finally, this study also recommends several immediate measures could be implemented to mitigate high impacts of deadly flash floods, although it still requires long-term significant efforts to protect human life and property in a country like china.",FLASH FLOOD; CHARACTERISTICS; DISASTER; CHINA,UNITED-STATES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,16,"ANONYMOUS, 2008, P313.;ASHLEY ST, 2008, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V47, P805, DOI 10.1175/2007JAMC1611.1.;BARREDO JI, 2007, NAT HAZARDS, V42, P125, DOI 10.1007/S11069-006-9065-2.;BENISTON M, 2011, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V14, P734, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2010.12.009.;BOSHER L., 2017, DISASTER RISK REDUCT.;CHI XX, 2016, THEOR APPL CLIMATOL, V124, P555, DOI 10.1007/S00704-015-1436-8.;CREUTIN JD, 2013, J HYDROL, V482, P14, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2012.11.009.;FERRO G, 2005, PREHOSPITAL DISASTER, V20, P316, DOI 10.1017/S1049023X00002776.;GAO Y, 2007, HEILONGJIANG METEORO, V34, P37.;GAUME E, 2004, J HYDROL, V286, P135, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2003.09.015.;GEORGAKAKOS KP, 1984, B AM METEOROL SOC, V65, P1186, DOI 10.1175/1520-0477(1984)065<1186:QPFTFU>2.0.CO,2.;GOURLEY JJ, 2017, B AM METEOROL SOC, V98, P361, DOI 10.1175/BAMS-D-15-00247.1.;GOURLEY JJ, 2013, B AM METEOROL SOC, V94, P799, DOI 10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00198.1.;GREEN C, 2013, FLOOD RISK MANAGEMEN, V1.;GUZZETTI F, 2005, ENVIRON MANAGE, V36, P15, DOI 10.1007/S00267-003-0257-1.;HE B, 2014, CHINA WATER RESOUR, V18, P11.;HONG Y., 2013, ENCY NATURAL HAZARDS, P324, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-1-4020-4399-4\_136.;JONKMAN SN, 2005, DISASTERS, V29, P75, DOI 10.1111/J.0361-3666.2005.00275.X.;KLEINEN T, 2007, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V81, P283, DOI 10.1007/S10584-006-9159-6.;MIAO LJ, 2016, INT J ENV RES PUB HE, V13, DOI 10.3390/IJERPH13090847.;REN H, 2007, CHINA WATER RESOUR, V14, P18.;SPITALAR M, 2014, J HYDROL, V519, P863, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2014.07.004.;STATE FLOOD CONTROL AND DROUGHT RELIEF OFFICE THE MINISTRY OF WATER RESOURCES OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, 2011, B FLOOD DROUGHT DISA.;SUN DY, 2012, WATER-SUI, V4, P272, DOI 10.3390/W4010272.;THE NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND REFORM COMMISSION OF THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA (NDRC), 2011, SMALL MED SIZ RIV DA, V4.;YANG HB, 2015, THEOR APPL CLIMATOL, V120, P773, DOI 10.1007/S00704-014-1208-X.;ZHAI P, 1999, WEATHER CLIMATE EXTR.","CHANG, QR (REPRINT AUTHOR), MWR, RES CTR FLOOD \& DROUGHT DISASTER REDUCT, BEIJING 100038, PEOPLES R CHINA.;CHANG, QR (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHINA INST WATER RESOURCES \& HYDROPOWER RES, STATE KEY LAB SIMULAT \& REGULAT WATER CYCLE RIVER, BEIJING 100038, PEOPLES R CHINA.;MA, MH (REPRINT AUTHOR), BEIJING NORMAL UNIV, BEIJING 100875, PEOPLES R CHINA.;MA, MH (REPRINT AUTHOR), TSINGHUA UNIV, DEPT HYDRAUL ENGN, STATE KEY LAB HYDROSCI \& ENGN, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA.;HE, BINGSHUN, CHANG, QINGRUI, TU, YONG, LI, QING, MWR, RES CTR FLOOD \& DROUGHT DISASTER REDUCT, BEIJING 100038, PEOPLES R CHINA.;HE, BINGSHUN, CHANG, QINGRUI, TU, YONG, LI, QING, CHINA INST WATER RESOURCES \& HYDROPOWER RES, STATE KEY LAB SIMULAT \& REGULAT WATER CYCLE RIVER, BEIJING 100038, PEOPLES R CHINA.;HUANG, XIANLONG, MINIST WATER RESOURCES PEOPLES REPUBL CHINA, BEIJING 100053, PEOPLES R CHINA.;MA, MEIHONG, BEIJING NORMAL UNIV, BEIJING 100875, PEOPLES R CHINA.;MA, MEIHONG, HONG, YANG, TSINGHUA UNIV, DEPT HYDRAUL ENGN, STATE KEY LAB HYDROSCI \& ENGN, BEIJING 100084, PEOPLES R CHINA.;ZHANG, KE, HOHAI UNIV, COLL HYDROL \& WATER RESOURCES, NANJING 210098, JIANGSU, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.1007/S11069-017-3052-7,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",,CHINA NATIONAL FLASH FLOOD DISASTER PREVENTION AND CONTROL PROJECT [126301001000150068]; CHINA INSTITUTE OF WATER RESOURCES AND HYDROPOWER RESEARCH INNOVATION TEAM PROJECT [JZ0145B2017]; FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR THE CENTRAL UNIVERSITIESFUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR THE CENTRAL UNIVERSITIES [2015B28514],,0921-030X,1,407-420,SPRINGER,90,2018,ISI000417720400020,27,"GEOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",30,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",HEBSIWHR.COM HUANGXLMWR.GOV.CN MMHKL2007163.COM CHANGQINGRUI126.COM KZHANGHHU.EDU.CN HONGYANGTSINGHUA.EDU.CN,,FP6FT,,"CHANG, QR (REPRINT AUTHOR), MWR, RES CTR FLOOD \& DROUGHT DISASTER REDUCT, BEIJING 100038, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,RES CTR FLOOD AND DROUGHT DISASTER REDUCT;CHINA INST WATER RESOURCES AND HYDROPOWER RES;MINIST WATER RESOURCES PEOPLES REPUBL CHINA;BEIJING NORMAL UNIV;TSINGHUA UNIV;HOHAI UNIV,RES CTR FLOOD AND DROUGHT DISASTER REDUCT,,"HE B, 2018, NAT HAZARDS","HE B, 2018, NAT HAZARDS",FALSE,1_2,0,0,0,0,0,13_14,0,1
301,Petrovic A;Kostadinov S;Dragicevic S,The inventory and characterization of torrential flood phenomenon in serbia,POLISH JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES,"Torrential floods are the most destructive and most frequent natural disasters in serbia with severe social, economic, cultural, and environmental consequences that deserve special attention. This paper presents a data-collection strategy and data analysis in terms of spatial and temporal characterization of the torrential flood phenomenon in serbia for the last 99 years. Based on the available information obtained from various reliable sources, we registered 848 torrential flood events for 1915-2013. The registered number of deaths from torrential floods is over 133, including 24 people from 1991 to 2010. Monthly distribution of registered torrential floods indicates that the majority of floods occurred in serbian territory in late spring (from may to the end of june) and the greatest number of torrential floods is registered in southern morava basin. This work resulted in creating a first inventory of torrential floods in serbia and its analysis for the purpose of the spatial and temporal distribution and characterization of this phenomenon. The inventory on torrential floods will be integrated in future in a unique multi-user database on natural hazards in serbia, and it should become a part of the european database of natural hazards.",INVENTORY; TORRENTIAL FLOOD; EVENT DISTRIBUTIONS; DAMAGE; FATALITIES; SERBIA,FLASH FLOODS; EUROPE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,13,"ABBOTT P.L., 2008, NATURAL DISASTERS.;ADHIKARI P, 2010, NAT HAZARDS, V55, P405, DOI 10.1007/S11069-010-9537-2.;BARREDO JI, 2007, NAT HAZARDS, V42, P125, DOI 10.1007/S11069-006-9065-2.;BATHURST J.

176,Burgess Cp;Taylor Ma;Stephenson T;Mandal A;Powell L,A macro-scale flood risk model for jamaica with impact of climate variability,NATURAL HAZARDS,"Floods account for more than half of the global hydrometeorological risks. Severe floods cause significant economic shocks and loss of lives, particularly for developing countries such as jamaica. There is need for more information on the present and projected flood risks to justify macro-scale planning for climate change adaptation and facilitate the decision-making processes. In this study, a catalogue of 198 flood events occurring between 1678 and 2010 is compiled for jamaica and used to examine the climatology, occurrence, trends, causes and duration of the island's severe events. The annual flood risk is estimated to be a loss of life rate of 4 persons and estimated annual damage of usd96.3 million per annum in 2010 values and approximately 0.84 \% of gdp per annum. Macro-scale models for flood risks (deaths and damages) are also developed using data from the flood catalogue and maximum precipitation at the town and parish level. The models examine the relationship between flood risks (death and damages) and extreme rainfall depths and intensities. Future climate risks of loss of lives and damages are predicted to increase 11 and 9 \%, respectively, to 4.4 persons and usd105.2 million per annum.",LOSS OF LIFE; FLOOD CATALOGUE; FLOOD RISK; MACRO-SCALE; CLIMATE CHANGE; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; ATLANTIC MULTI-DECADAL OSCILLATION,EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS; FLASH FLOODS; CARIBBEAN RAINFALL; NATURAL DISASTERS; TROPICAL PACIFIC; UNITED-STATES; EUROPE; MANAGEMENT; ATLANTIC; LIFE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,4,"ABOELATA M, 2005, P INT S STOCH HYDR M.;ANGELES M, 2010, J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS, V115, P1.;ASHLEY ST, 2008, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V47, P805, DOI 10.1175/2007JAMC1611.1.;BANK OF JAMAICA, 2013, HIST RAT JMD USD.;BARDOSSY A, 1990, THEOR APPL CLIMATOL, V42, P155, DOI 10.1007/BF00866871.;BARREDO JI, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P97, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-97-2009.;BARREDO JI, 2007, NAT HAZARDS, V42, P125, DOI 10.1007/S11069-006-9065-2.;BARTHEL F, 2012, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V113, P215, DOI 10.1007/S10584-011-0331-2.;BEJARANO L, 2008, J CLIMATE, V21, P3051, DOI 10.1175/2007JCLI1679.1.;BORGA M, 2011, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V14, P834, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2011.05.017.;BURGESS C, 2013, INT C FLOOD RES EXP, P173.;CAMPBELL JD, 2011, INT J CLIMATOL, V31, P1866, DOI 10.1002/JOC.2200.;CASPARY H.J., 1995, PHYS CHEM EARTH, V20, P459.;CAVALLO E., 2009, IDB WORKING PAPER SE, VIDB-WP-124.;CHARVERIAT CELINE, 2000, 434 INT DEV BANK RES.;CHRISTENSEN JH, 2003, NATURE, V421, P805, DOI 10.1038/421805A.;COUMOU D, 2012, NAT CLIM CHANGE, V2, P491, DOI 10.1038/NCLIMATE1452.;CZAJKOWSKI J, 2013, ENVIRON RES LETT, V8, DOI 10.1088/1748-9326/8/4/044056.;CZAJKOWSKI J, 2011, NAT HAZARDS, V59, P1513, DOI 10.1007/S11069-011-9849-X.;DAI FC, 2002, ENG GEOL, V64, P65, DOI 10.1016/S0013-7952(01)00093-X.;DIERAUER J, 2012, J HYDROL, V450, P1, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2012.05.044.;EBI KL, 2005, EPIDEMIOL REV, V27, P115, DOI 10.1093/EPIREV/MXI006.;FREEMAN P, 2000, ANN WORLD BANK C DEV, P26.;FRENCH J, 1983, PUBLIC HEALTH REP, V98, P584.;GABRIELE VILLARINI, 2013, JAWRA, V49, P825.;GALL M, 2009, B AM METEOROL SOC, V90, P799, DOI 10.1175/2008BAMS2721.1.;GAMBLE DW, 1997, PHYS GEOGR, V18, P496, DOI 10.1080/02723646.1997.10642632.;GAUME E, 2009, J HYDROL, V367, P70, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2008.12.028.;GILLES DROGUE, 2004, J HYDROL, V293, P255.;GOLIAN S, 2010, WATER RESOUR MANAG, V24, P3547, DOI 10.1007/S11269-010-9619-7.;GOULDBY B, 2006, RISK PERFORMANCE UNC.;GUHA-SAPIR D., 2004, 30 YEARS NATURAL DIS.;GUL GO, 2013, NAT HAZARDS, V69, P403, DOI 10.1007/S11069-013-0717-8.;HALL JW, 2005, NAT HAZARDS, V36, P147, DOI 10.1007/S11069-004-4546-7.;HOAGLIN DC, 1986, J AM STAT ASSOC, V81, P991, DOI 10.2307/2289073.;HOCHRAINER S., 2006, MACROECONOMIC RISK M, DOI 10.1007/978-3-8350-9441-3.PDF.;ISHEMO A, 2009, MANAG ENVIRON QUAL, V20, P451, DOI 10.1108/14777830910963771.;JIANG WG, 2009, PROG NAT SCI-MATER, V19, P1419, DOI 10.1016/J.PNSC.2008.12.010.;JIN DH, 2010, CLIM DYNAM, V34, P1015, DOI 10.1007/S00382-009-0619-3.;JOHNSTONE W.

89,Pereira S;Zezere Jl;Quaresma I;Santos Pp;Santos M,Mortality patterns of hydro-geomorphologic disasters,RISK ANALYSIS,"Social impacts caused by floods and landslides in portugal in the period of 1865-2010 are gathered in the disaster database. This database contains 1,902 hydro-geomorphologic cases that caused 1,248 fatalities (81\% and 19\% associated with floods and landslides, respectively). The use of the disaster database allowed for: (i) the analysis of the frequency and the temporal evolution of fatal floods and landslides, (ii) the analysis of the spatio-temporal distribution of fatalities, (iii) the identification of the most deadly flood and landside types, (iv) the verification of gender tendencies in mortalities, and (v) the evaluation of individual and societal risk. The highest number of flood and landslide cases and related mortalities occurred in the period of 1935-1969. After this period, the number of flood and landslide mortalities decreased, although landslide fatalities remained higher than those registered in the period of 1865-1934. The occurrence of flood fatalities was widespread in the country, with an important cluster in the lisbon region and in the tagus valley, while fatalities caused by landslides mainly occurred in the north of the tagus valley. Flash floods caused the majority of fatalities associated with floods, while falls and flows were responsible for the highest number of fatalities associated with landslides. Males were found to have the highest frequency of fatalities. In the case of floods, the majority of fatalities were found both outdoors and inside of buildings in rural areas while fatalities inside buildings were dominant in landslide cases, mostly in rural areas.",DISASTER DATABASE; FLOODS; LANDSLIDES; MORTALITY; PORTUGAL,FLOOD FATALITIES; LANDSLIDE RISK; NORTH; PORTUGAL; RAINFALL; DATABASE; GENDER,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,15,"ALEXANDER D.

Human exposure, vulnerability, fatality and injury rates can be minimized by identifying and then mitigating the causative factors for human impacts. A database of flash flooding was used for statistical analysis of human impacts across the u.s. 21,549 flash flood events were analyzed during a 6-year period from october 2006 to 2012. Based on the information available in the database, physical parameters were introduced and then correlated to the reported human impacts. Probability density functions of the frequency of flash flood events and the pdf of occurrences weighted by the number of injuries and fatalities were used to describe the influence of each parameter. The factors that emerged as the most influential on human impacts are short flood durations, small catchment sizes in rural areas, vehicles, and nocturnal events with low visibility. Analyzing and correlating a diverse range of parameters to human impacts give us important insights into what contributes to fatalities and injuries and further raises questions on how to manage them.

75,Pereira S;Diakakis M;Deligiannakis G;Zezere Jl,Comparing flood mortality in portugal and greece (western and eastern mediterranean),INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,"For the first time flood mortality is analysed and compared between a western (portugal) and an eastern mediterranean country (greece). Flood fatalities are examined and compared in terms of frequency, temporal evolution, spatial distribution, deadliest flood types, gender of the victims, circumstances surrounding fatalities, and individual and societal risk. A common flood fatalities database was formed for the period 1960-2010 by merging the disaster database for portugal and the greek database individual flood cases generated more deaths in greece than in portugal (excluding an outlier flash flood event in the latter). Despite some fluctuations evidence of a gradual decrease in fatality numbers were recorded for both countries. Since the 1980's the number of flood cases with multiple fatalities has been gradually declining, due to changes in qualitative characteristics of mortality. Flood fatalities predominantly occur during autumn in greece and during winter in portugal. In both greece and portugal flash floods were responsible for more than 80\% of the total mortality. The main metropolitan areas of each country were found to be hotspots of flood mortality, a trend connected, with the higher population density along the coastal areas combined with the expansion of urban fabric towards flood-prone areas. Gender distribution of fatalities indicates that males are more vulnerable in both countries. The circumstances surrounding fatalities showed that fatalities occurring inside buildings have been gradually reducing in time, while vehicle-related deaths have been rising, showing that individuals hold an active role when they voluntarily enter in floodwaters during a flood.",FLOOD MORTALITY; INDIVIDUAL RISK; SOCIETAL RISK; PORTUGAL; GREECE,CIRCULATION WEATHER TYPES; PRECIPITATION VARIABILITY; SPATIAL VARIABILITY; HAZARD AREAS; HUMAN HEALTH; FATALITIES; IMPACTS; LIFE; LANDSLIDES; AUSTRALIA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,11,"AHERN M, 2005, EPIDEMIOL REV, V27, P36, DOI 10.1093/EPIREV/MXI004.;ALDERMAN K, 2012, ENVIRON INT, V47, P37, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVINT.2012.06.003.;ALFIERI L, 2015, HYDROL EARTH SYST SC, V19, P2247, DOI 10.5194/HESS-19-2247-2015.;ASHLEY ST, 2008, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V47, P805, DOI 10.1175/2007JAMC1611.1.;BANGASH RF, 2012, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V440, P60, DOI 10.1016/J.SCITOTENV.2012.08.031.;BARREDO JI, 2007, NAT HAZARDS, V42, P125, DOI 10.1007/S11069-006-9065-2.;BECKER JS, 2015, WEATHER CLIM SOC, V7, P321, DOI 10.1175/WCAS-D-14-00030.1.;BERN C, 1993, B WORLD HEALTH ORGAN, V71, P73.;BOISSIER L, 2013, THESIS.;BORDEN KA, 2008, INT J HEALTH GEOGR, V7, DOI 10.1186/1476-072X-7-64.;LLASAT MC, 2013, HOUILLE BLANCHE, P5, DOI 10.1051/1HB/2013001.;CHACON J, 2006, B ENG GEOL ENVIRON, V65, P341, DOI 10.1007/S10064-006-0064-Z.;COATES L, 1999, AUST GEOGR, V30, P391, DOI 10.1080/00049189993657.;CORTESI N, 2013, HYDROL EARTH SYST SC, V17, P665, DOI 10.5194/HESS-17-665-2013.;CORTESI N, 2014, INT J CLIMATOL, V34, P2661, DOI 10.1002/JOC.3866.;CUESTA MJD, 1999, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V30, P125.;DIAKAKIS M, 2014, J FLOOD RISK MANAG, V7, P332, DOI 10.1111/JFR3.12053.;DIAKAKIS M., 2014, J FLOOD RISK MANAG.;DIAKAKIS M., 2015, J FLOOD RISK MANAG.;DIAKAKIS M., 2011, ADV RES AQUATIC ENV, V1, P199.;DIAKAKIS M, 2016, ENVIRON HAZARDS-UK, V15, P148, DOI 10.1080/17477891.2016.1147412.;DIAKAKIS M, 2013, ENVIRON HAZARDS-UK, V12, P278, DOI 10.1080/17477891.2013.832651.;DIAKAKIS M, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V62, P485, DOI 10.1007/S11069-012-0090-Z.;DOOCY SHANNON, 2013, PLOS CURR, V5, DOI 10.1371/CURRENTS.DIS.F4DEB457904936B07C09DAA98EE8171A.;DROBOT S.

128,Diakakis M,Have flood mortality qualitative characteristics changed during the last decades? The case study of greece,ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS,"Despite the dramatic increase in recorded flood events in Greece in the last decades, recent findings show that related mortality does not show a corresponding rise. This work develops and studies a database of flood-related fatalities to investigate qualitative changes in flood mortality in the country between 1960 and 2010. Observations show a shift in the circumstances under which fatal incidents occurred and in the demographics of the victims. In particular, indoor fatalities and cases in urban environments gradually decrease in favour of incidents occurring outdoors, in rural settings, mostly using motor vehicles. The number of fatalities per flood event show a decline, indicating that multiple-fatality incidents are gradually disappearing and that advances in protection have an impact on mortality. The increase in the use of vehicles, the improvements in the structural integrity of buildings and the advances in early warning and civil protection practices are found to influence mortality both in qualitative and in quantitative terms.",FLOOD MORTALITY; FATALITIES; GREECE,SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; UNITED-STATES; FLASH FLOODS; DISASTER; DEATHS; FATALITIES; HURRICANE; RISK; LIFE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,8,"ALDERMAN K, 2012, ENVIRON INT, V47, P37, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVINT.2012.06.003.;ALFIERI L., 2015, HYDROL EARTH SYST SC, V12, P1119, DOI DOI 10.5194/HESSD-12-1119-2015.;ASHLEY ST, 2008, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V47, P805, DOI 10.1175/2007JAMC1611.1.;BRUNKARD J, 2008, DISASTER MED PUBLIC, V2, P215, DOI 10.1097/DMP.0B013E31818AAF55.;DIAKAKIS M, 2017, J FLOOD RISK MANAG, V10, P115, DOI 10.1111/JFR3.12166.;DIAKAKIS M, 2014, J FLOOD RISK MANAG, V7, P332, DOI 10.1111/JFR3.12053.;DIAKAKIS M, 2014, ISPRS INT GEO-INF, V3, P96, DOI 10.3390/IJGI3010096.;DIAKAKIS M, 2013, ENVIRON HAZARDS-UK, V12, P278, DOI 10.1080/17477891.2013.832651.;DIAKAKIS M, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V62, P485, DOI 10.1007/S11069-012-0090-Z.;DIGITAL NEWSPAPERS COLLECTION, 2010, DIGITAL NEWSPAPERS C.;DROBOT S.

237,Ma M;He B;Wan J;Jia P;Guo X;Gao L;Maguire Lw;Hong Y,Characterizing the flash flooding risks from 2011 to 2016 over china,WATER,"Flash floods induced by heavy rainfall occur frequently in china, which cause severe damages or even casualties every year. Flash floods generally occur in small catchments, and therefore were poorly documented. A database including 963 flash flood events in china is compiled and studied in this study. Analytical results (a) indicate flash flood condition in china, (b) shed light on the spatial-temporal distribution of flash flood under heavy rainfall and (c) detect the characteristics of the 2016 flash flood. In 2016, the deaths due to flash floods were severe and concentrated, accounting for about half of the elderly and children. Hebei and fujian provinces were most affected by flash floods. The disasters mainly occurred in july and the major types were river floods.

The proposed model was run with a 3-dimensional dataset (7 width height depth), which was constructed through including seven neighbor pixels (vertically and horizontally) from landslide location and 12 predictor variables. Muong te district, lai chau province, vietnam was selected as the case study, as it had recently undergone severe impacts of landslides and flash floods. The performance of this proposed model was compared with conventional classifiers, i.e., random forest, random subspace, and cnn-optimized adaptive gradient descend, by using standard metrics. The results showed that the cnn-optimized mfo (root mean square error \& x003d, 0.3685, mean absolute error \& x003d, 0.2888, area under receiver characteristic curve \& x003d, 0.889 and overall accuracy \& x003d, 80.1056 \& x0025,) outperformed the benchmarked methods in all comparing indicators.

574,Alipour A;Ahmadalipour A;Abbaszadeh P;Moradkhani H,Leveraging machine learning for predicting flash flood damage in the southeast us,ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH LETTERS,"Flash flood is a recurrent natural hazard with substantial impacts in the southeast us (seus) due to the frequent torrential rainfalls that occur in the region, which are triggered by tropical storms, thunderstorms, and hurricanes. Flash floods are costly natural hazards, primarily due to their rapid onset. Therefore, predicting property damage of flash floods is imperative for proactive disaster management. Here, we present a systematic framework that considers a variety of features explaining different components of risk (i.e. Hazard, vulnerability, and exposure), and examine multiple machine learning methods to predict flash flood damage. A large database of flash flood events consisting of more than 14 000 events are assessed for training and testing the methodology, while a multitude of data sources are utilized to acquire reliable information related to each event. A variable selection approach was employed to alleviate the complexity of the dataset and facilitate the model development process. The random forest (rf) method was then used to map the identified input covariates to a target variable (i.e. Property damage). The rf model was implemented in two modes: first, as a binary classifier to estimate if a region of interest was damaged in any particular flood event, and then as a regression model to predict the amount of property damage associated with each event. The results indicate that the proposed approach is successful not only for classifying damaging events (with an accuracy of 81\%), but also for predicting flash flood damage with a good agreement with the observed property damage. This study is among the few efforts for predicting flash flood damage across a large domain using mesoscale input variables, and the findings demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.",FLASH FLOOD; RISK; FLOOD DAMAGE; MACHINE LEARNING,WATER-RESOURCES APPLICATIONS; ARTIFICIAL NEURAL-NETWORKS; EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS; RISK-ASSESSMENT; INPUT DETERMINATION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MODELS; HAZARD; PRECIPITATION; VULNERABILITY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,none,"ALIPOUR, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ALABAMA, CTR COMPLEX HYDROSYST RES, DEPT CIVIL CONSTRUCT \& ENVIRONM ENGN, TUSCALOOSA, AL 35487 USA.;ALIPOUR, ATIEH, AHMADALIPOUR, ALI, ABBASZADEH, PEYMAN, MORADKHANI, HAMID, UNIV ALABAMA, CTR COMPLEX HYDROSYST RES, DEPT CIVIL CONSTRUCT \& ENVIRONM ENGN, TUSCALOOSA, AL 35487 USA.",10.1088/1748-9326/AB6EDD,"TEMPLE CIRCUS, TEMPLE WAY, BRISTOL BS1 6BE, ENGLAND",,,,1748-9326,2,,IOP PUBLISHING LTD,15,2020,ISI000522236600001,76,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES",1,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES",AALIPOURCRIMSON.UA.EDU,,KY0AP,,"ALIPOUR, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ALABAMA, CTR COMPLEX HYDROSYST RES, DEPT CIVIL CONSTRUCT \& ENVIRONM ENGN, TUSCALOOSA, AL 35487 USA",ISI,UNIV ALABAMA,UNIV ALABAMA,,"ALIPOUR A, 2020, ENVIRON RES LETT","ALIPOUR A, 2020, ENVIRON RES LETT",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0,2,2_11,1,1
112,Laudan J;Roezer V;Sieg T;Vogel K;Thieken Ah,Damage assessment in braunsbach 2016: data collection and analysis for an improved understanding of damaging processes during flash floods,NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Flash floods are caused by intense rainfall events and represent an insufficiently understood phenomenon in germany. As a result of higher precipitation intensities, flash floods might occur more frequently in future. In combination with changing land use patterns and urbanisation, damage mitigation, insurance and risk management in flash-flood-prone regions are becoming increasingly important. However, a better understanding of damage caused by flash floods requires ex post collection of relevant but yet sparsely available information for research. At the end of may 2016, very high and concentrated rainfall intensities led to severe flash floods in several southern german municipalities. The small town of braunsbach stood as a prime example of the devastating potential of such events. Eight to ten days after the flash flood event, damage assessment and data collection were conducted in braunsbach by investigating all affected buildings and their surroundings. To record and store the data on site, the open-source software bundle kobocollect was used as an efficient and easy way to gather information. Since the damage driving factors of flash floods are expected to differ from those of riverine flooding, a post-hoc data analysis was performed, aiming to identify the influence of flood processes and building attributes on damage grades, which reflect the extent of structural damage. Data analyses include the application of random forest, a random general linear model and multinomial logistic regression as well as the construction of a local impact map to reveal influences on the damage grades. Further, a spearman's rho correlation matrix was calculated. The results reveal that the damage driving factors of flash floods differ from those of riverine floods to a certain extent. The exposition of a building in flow direction shows an especially strong correlation with the damage grade and has a high predictive power within the constructed damage models. Additionally, the results suggest that building materials as well as various building aspects, such as the existence of a shop window and the surroundings, might have an effect on the resulting damage. To verify and confirm the outcomes as well as to support future mitigation strategies, risk management and planning, more comprehensive and systematic data collection is necessary.",,MAI 29TH; FLOW; VULNERABILITY; 2016-ORIGIN; PATHWAYS; GERMANY; IMPACTS; MODEL,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,7,"BENISTON M, 2007, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V81, P71, DOI 10.1007/S10584-006-9226-Z.;BORGA M, 2014, J HYDROL, V518, P194, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2014.05.022.;BRACKEN LJ, 2016, NAT HAZARDS, V82, PS217, DOI 10.1007/S11069-016-2284-2.;BREIMAN L, 2001, MACH LEARN, V45, P5, DOI 10.1023/A:1010933404324.;BRONSTERT A, 2017, HYDROL WASSERBEWIRTS, V61, P150, DOI 10.5675/HYWA\_2017,3\_1.;BUBECK P, 2013, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V23, P1327, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2013.05.009.;CARDONA O-D, 2012, SPECIAL REPORT WORKI, P65.;ECKLE M, 2016, ISCRAM 2016 C RIO DE.;EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENT AGENCY, 2017, CLIM CHANG IMP VULN.;FUCHS S, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V64, P2129, DOI 10.1007/S11069-011-0081-5.;GAUME E, 2009, J HYDROL, V367, P70, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2008.12.028.;GDV, 2016, NAT 2016.;HLAVCOVA K, 2016, J HYDROL HYDROMECH, V64, P304, DOI 10.1515/JOHH-2016-0041.;HUNGR O, 2014, LANDSLIDES, V11, P167, DOI 10.1007/S10346-013-0436-Y.;JACOBI S, 2016, GEOMAT NAT HAZ RISK, V7, P1785, DOI 10.1080/19475705.2016.1155080.;KIENZLER S., KW KORRESPONDENZ WAS, V8, P680.;KLONNER C, 2016, ISPRS INT J GEO-INF, V5, DOI 10.3390/IJGI5070103.;KREIBICH H, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P1679, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-1679-2009.;KREIBICH H, 2017, RISK ANAL, V37, P774, DOI 10.1111/RISA.12650.;KUNDZEWICZ ZW, 2017, HYDROLOG SCI J, V62, P1, DOI 10.1080/02626667.2016.1241398.;LANDKREIS SCHWABISCH HALL, UNW SCHAD.;MAIWALD H, 2015, INT J SAFETY SECURIT, V5, P222.;MAIWALD H, 2016, BAUTECHNIK, V93, P925, DOI 10.1002/BATE.201600087.;MAKSIMOVIC C, 2009, J HYDRAUL RES, V47, P512, DOI 10.1080/00221686.2009.9522027.;MERZ B, 2010, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V10, P1697, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-10-1697-2010.;MILANESI L, 2015, WATER RESOUR RES, V51, P182, DOI 10.1002/2014WR016172.;MOLINARI D, 2014, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V14, P901, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-14-901-2014.;MUNICH RE, 2017, TOP GEO 2016 NAT CAT.;MURAWSKI A, 2016, INT J CLIMATOL, V36, P2582, DOI 10.1002/JOC.4514.;OSBERGHAUS D., 2016, ZVERSWISS, V105, P289, DOI [10.1007/S12297-016-0341-2, DOI 10.1007/S12297-016-0341-2].;PAPATHOMA-KOHLE M, 2016, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V16, P1771, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-16-1771-2016.;PIERSON TC, 1987, RHEOLOGIC CLASSIFICA.;RIPLEY BD, 1996, PATTERN RECOGNITION.;SCHELHORN S.

409,Jhagdambi R;Zhong B,Using big data in early warning system of flash floods in mauritius,FORENSIC ENGINEERING 2018: FORGING FORENSIC FRONTIERS,"Located in the tropics, the republic of mauritius is exposed to a number of natural disasters such as cyclones and torrential rains commonly causing flash floods. The world risk report 2016 ranked mauritius 7th on the list of countries that are more exposed to natural hazards. Early warning systems (ews) are recognized in both the hyogo framework for disaster reduction (2005-2015) and the sendai framework for disaster risk reduction (2015-2030) as an important element of disaster risk reduction. When disasters strike, first responders need to understand new situations on the ground. They require timely, validated information that can be integrated into information products for efficient communication, situational understanding, and ultimately for better decision-making. Communication technology play an important role in disaster management, especially in the preparedness phase. This study assesses the status of ews of floods in mauritius, key gaps and challenges, and will propose a framework for a people centered early warning system using big data for flash floods in the country.

To reach this objective, a random forest classifier is applied to assess the likelihood of fatality occurrence for a given circumstance as a function of representative indicators. Here, vehicle-related circumstance is chosen as the literature indicates that most fatalities from flash flooding fall in this category. A database of flash flood events, with and without human losses from 2001 to 2011 in the united states, is supplemented with other variables describing the storm event, the spatial distribution of the sensitive characteristics of the exposed population, and built environment at the county level. The catastrophic flash floods of may 2015 in the states of texas and oklahoma are used as a case study to map the dynamics of the estimated probabilistic human risk on a daily scale. The results indicate the importance of time- and space-dependent human vulnerability and risk assessment for short-fuse flood events. The need for more systematic human impact data collection is also highlighted to advance impact-based predictive models for flash flood casualties using machine-learning approaches in the future.",DYNAMIC RISK MAPPING; MACHINE-LEARNING PREDICTIONS; PROBABILITY OF FLASH FLOOD CASUALTY,SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; WEATHER FORECASTS; GARD REGION; FATALITIES; UNCERTAINTY; AUSTRALIA; EXPOSURE; CURVES; COUNTY; AREAS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,10,none,"TERTI, G (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV GRENOBLE ALPES, CNRS, IRD, GRENOBLE INP,IGE, F-38000 GRENOBLE, FRANCE.;TERTI, GALATEIA, RUIN, ISABELLE, BLANCHET, JULIETTE, ANQUETIN, SANDRINE, UNIV GRENOBLE ALPES, CNRS, IRD, GRENOBLE INP,IGE, F-38000 GRENOBLE, FRANCE.;GOURLEY, JONATHAN J., NOAA, NSSL, NORMAN, OK USA.;KIRSTETTER, PIERRE, FLAMIG, ZACHARY, UNIV OKLAHOMA, NOAA, NATL SEVERE STORMS LAB, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA.;KIRSTETTER, PIERRE, FLAMIG, ZACHARY, UNIV OKLAHOMA, ATMOSPHER RADAR RES CTR, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA.;ARTHUR, AMI, UNIV OKLAHOMA, COOPERAT INST MESOSCALE METEOROL STUDIES, NORMAN, OK 73019 USA.",10.1111/RISA.12921,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,"LABEX OSUG2020 (INVESTISSEMENTS D'AVENIR, FRANCE)FRENCH NATIONAL RESEARCH AGENCY (ANR) [ANR10 LABX56]; DISASTER RELIEF APPROPRIATIONS ACT OF 2013 [P.L. 113-2, NA14OAR4830100]",,0272-4332,1,140-161,WILEY,39,2019,ISI000454958400010,79,"PUBLIC, ENVIRONMENTAL \& OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, MATHEMATICS, MATHEMATICAL METHODS IN SOCIAL SCIENCES",18,"PUBLIC, ENVIRONMENTAL \& OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH, MATHEMATICS, INTERDISCIPLINARY APPLICATIONS, SOCIAL SCIENCES, MATHEMATICAL METHODS",GALATEIA.TERTIUNIV-GRENOBLE-ALPES.FR,,HG4PW,,"TERTI, G (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV GRENOBLE ALPES, CNRS, IRD, GRENOBLE INP,IGE, F-38000 GRENOBLE, FRANCE",ISI,UNIV GRENOBLE ALPES;UNIV OKLAHOMA;UNIV OKLAHOMA;UNIV OKLAHOMA,UNIV GRENOBLE ALPES,,"TERTI G, 2019, RISK ANAL","TERTI G, 2019, RISK ANAL",FALSE,0,7,0,0,0,1,2_14_16,0,1

In this study, we used four machine-learning methods, namely kernel logistic regression (klr), radial basis function classifier (rbfc), multinomial naive bayes (nbm), and logistic model tree (lmt) to generate flash flood susceptibility maps at the minor part of nghe an province of the center region (vietnam) where recurrent flood problems are being experienced. Performance of these four methods was evaluated to select the best method for flash flood susceptibility mapping. In the model studies, ten flash flood conditioning factors, namely soil, slope, curvature, river density, flow direction, distance from rivers, elevation, aspect, land use, and geology, were chosen based on topography and geo-environmental conditions of the site. For the validation of models, the area under receiver operating characteristic (roc), area under curve (auc), and various statistical indices were used. The results indicated that performance of all the models is good for generating flash flood susceptibility maps (auc=0.983-0.988). However, performance of lmt model is the best among the four methods (lmt: auc=0.988, klr: auc=0.985, rbfc: auc=0.984, and nbm: auc = 0.983).

Flash floods are significantly affected by the intensification of extreme climate events and interactions with exposed and vulnerable socio-economic systems impede regional development processes. Hence, it is important to estimate the loss due to flash floods before the disaster occurs. However, there are no comprehensive vulnerability assessment results for flash floods in china. Fortunately, the national mountain flood disaster investigation project provided a foundation to develop this proposed assessment. In this study, an index system was established from the exposure and disaster reduction capability categories, and is based on analytic hierarchy process (ahp) methods. We evaluated flash flood vulnerability by adopting the support vector machine (svm) model. Our results showed 439 counties with high and extremely high vulnerability (accounting for 10.5\% of the land area and corresponding to approximately 100 million hectares (ha)), 571 counties with moderate vulnerability (accounting for 19.18\% of the land area and corresponding to approximately 180 million ha), and 1128 counties with low and extremely low vulnerability (accounting for 39.43\% of the land area and corresponding to approximately 370 million ha). The highly-vulnerable counties were mainly concentrated in the south and southeast regions of china, moderately-vulnerable counties were primarily concentrated in the central, northern, and southwestern regions of china, and low-vulnerability counties chiefly occurred in the northwest regions of china. Additionally, the results of the spatial autocorrelation suggested that the ``high-high values of spatial agglomeration areas mainly occurred in the zhejiang, fujian, jiangxi, hunan, guangxi, chongqing, and beijing areas. On the basis of these results, our study can be used as a proposal for population and building distribution readjustments, and the management of flash floods in china.",GIS; FLASH FLOOD VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; EXPOSURE; DISASTER REDUCTION CAPABILITY; SVM; CHINA,ANALYTICAL HIERARCHY PROCESS; LANDSLIDE SUSCEPTIBILITY; RISK-ASSESSMENT; NATURAL DISASTERS; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; EXTREME RAINFALL; HAZARD; RESILIENCE; REGION; AHP,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,7,none,"CHENG, WM (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHINESE ACAD SCI, INST GEOG SCI \& NAT RESOURCES RES, STATE KEY LAB RESOURCES \& ENVIRONM INFORMAT SYST, BEIJING 100101, PEOPLES R CHINA.;CHENG, WM (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV CHINESE ACAD SCI, BEIJING 100049, PEOPLES R CHINA.;CHENG, WM (REPRINT AUTHOR), JIANGSU CTR COLLABORAT INNOVAT GEOG INFORMAT RESO, NANJING 210023, JIANGSU, PEOPLES R CHINA.;XIONG, JUNNAN, LI, JIN, SOUTHWEST PETR UNIV, SCH CIVIL ENGN \& ARCHITECTURE, CHENGDU 610500, SICHUAN, PEOPLES R CHINA.;XIONG, JUNNAN, CHENG, WEIMING, WANG, NAN, CHINESE ACAD SCI, INST GEOG SCI \& NAT RESOURCES RES, STATE KEY LAB RESOURCES \& ENVIRONM INFORMAT SYST, BEIJING 100101, PEOPLES R CHINA.;CHENG, WEIMING, UNIV CHINESE ACAD SCI, BEIJING 100049, PEOPLES R CHINA.;CHENG, WEIMING, JIANGSU CTR COLLABORAT INNOVAT GEOG INFORMAT RESO, NANJING 210023, JIANGSU, PEOPLES R CHINA.;GUO, LIANG, CHINA INST WATER RESOURCES \& HYDROPOWER RES, BEIJING 100038, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.3390/IJGI8070297,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,CHINA ACADEMY OF SCIENCES STRATEGIC LEADING SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PROJECT [XDA20030302]; NATIONAL MOUNTAIN FLOOD DISASTER SURVEY AND EVALUATION PROJECT OF CHINESE ACADEMY OF WATER SCIENCES [SHZH-IWHR-57]; CHINA GEOLOGICAL SURVEY PROJECTCHINA GEOLOGICAL SURVEY [DD20190637]; SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PROJECT OF XIZANG AUTONOMOUS REGION [XZ201901-GA-07]; OPEN TOPIC OF DIGITAL FUJIAN INSTITUTE OF LARGE DATA FOR NATURAL DISASTER MONITORING [NDMBD2018003]; SCIENTIFIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION TEAM PROJECT OF SOUTHWEST PETROLEUM UNIVERSITY [2017CXTD09],,2220-9964,7,,MDPI,8,2019,ISI000478616400008,69,"PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY, REMOTE SENSING",20,"GEOGRAPHY, PHYSICAL, REMOTE SENSING",CHENGWMLREIS.AC.CN,,IN4AB,,"CHENG, WM (REPRINT AUTHOR), CHINESE ACAD SCI, INST GEOG SCI \& NAT RESOURCES RES, STATE KEY LAB RESOURCES \& ENVIRONM INFORMAT SYST, BEIJING 100101, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,SOUTHWEST PETR UNIV;INST GEOG SCI AND NAT RESOURCES RES;UNIV CHINESE ACAD SCI;JIANGSU CTR COLLABORAT INNOVAT GEOG INFORMAT RESO;CHINA INST WATER RESOURCES AND HYDROPOWER RES,INST GEOG SCI AND NAT RESOURCES RES,,"XIONG J, 2019, ISPRS INT GEO-INF","XIONG J, 2019, ISPRS INT GEO-INF",FALSE,1,0,2,0,0,0,2_3_4,2,1
116,Hu Hb,Rainstorm flash flood risk assessment using genetic programming: a case study of risk zoning in beijing,NATURAL HAZARDS,"In this study, a genetic programming (gp) algorithm is introduced to solve the symbolic regression problem for flash flood risk zoning in beijing. Gp operates in simulation of biological revolution and can avoid arbitrariness in risk estimates. Herein, this revolutionary computing searched for an appropriate model to best fit the training samples which comprise the data fields of the predictand of ripley's k-values to be the posterior risk, and the predictors of the rainstorm hazard index value (rhiv), physical vulnerability, terrain factor, impervious surface area, and population density. After generations of revolution, the optimal fit regressions for estimating the risk value were determined in the form of function (parse) trees. Also, the grid risk values were calculated using the deduced regression. The risk zoning map indicates that the risk values are higher in urban areas, which is reasonable in comparison with the distribution of historical flash flood events. With an explicit model structure, this symbolic regression manifests that the risk value is mainly determined by the rhiv and impervious land surface and is weakly correlated with the other risk factors, e.g., the physical vulnerability, the terrain factor, and population density. Our research demonstrates that gp in an artificial intelligence manner meets the needs of risk assessment in determining the optimal fit regressions and is a promising technique for future applications. Meanwhile, approaches are still available for improving the gp application in the risk assessment, e.g., considering the historical losses in posterior risk estimations and improvement in the sampling training data.",GENETIC PROGRAMMING; FLOOD; RISK ASSESSMENT; ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE,PRECIPITATION; MANAGEMENT; WEATHER; FREQUENCY; DISASTER; EVENTS; MODEL; BASIN,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,7,"ARNOLD CL, 1996, J AM PLANN ASSOC, V62, P243, DOI 10.1080/01944369608975688.;CANTET P, 2011, STOCH ENV RES RISK A, V25, P429, DOI 10.1007/S00477-010-0440-X.;CHEN J, 2001, INT J GEOGR INF SCI, V15, P201, DOI 10.1080/13658810010017892.;COOK A, 2009, J HYDROL, V377, P131, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2009.08.015.;MENDES BVD, 2009, STOCH ENV RES RISK A, V23, P399, DOI 10.1007/S00477-008-0220-Z.;DEGAETANO AT, 2009, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V48, P2086, DOI 10.1175/2009JAMC2179.1.;DOWNING T., 2001, UNEP POLICY SERIES.;DUNNE T, 1970, WATER RESOUR RES, V6, P478, DOI 10.1029/WR006I002P00478.;DURKEE JD, 2012, B AM METEOROL SOC, V93, P611, DOI 10.1175/BAMS-D-11-00076.1.;GRIMM AM, 2011, STOCH ENV RES RISK A, V25, P537, DOI 10.1007/S00477-010-0420-1.;GUMRUKCUOGLU M, 2010, NAT HAZARDS, V55, P467, DOI 10.1007/S11069-010-9540-7.;GUO JL, 2013, STOCH ENV RES RISK A, V27, P459, DOI 10.1007/S00477-012-0643-4.;HOAI NX, 2001, P 5 AUSTR JAP COJ WO, P52.;HOLLAND JH, 1992, ADAPTATION NATURAL A.;HU HB, 2015, NAT HAZARDS, V78, P1225, DOI 10.1007/S11069-015-1766-Y.;HU HB, 2014, INT J GEOGR INF SCI, V28, P1765, DOI 10.1080/13658816.2014.898767.;HUANG C., 1997, J FUZZY LOGIC INTELL, V14, P141.;IPCC, 2001, CLIM CHANG 2001 IMP.;JONGEJAN RB, 2015, RISK ANAL, V35, P252, DOI 10.1111/RISA.12285.;KAPLAN S., 1981, RISK ANAL, V1, P11, DOI DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.1981.TB01350.X.;KIM J, 2011, NAT HAZARDS, V59, P1561, DOI 10.1007/S11069-011-9852-2.;KIM YO, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V63, P1203, DOI 10.1007/S11069-012-0221-6.;KOZA J.

490,Yang D;Yang A;Qiu H;Zhou Y;Herrero H;Fu Cs;Yu Q;Tang J,A citizen-contributed gis approach for evaluating the impacts of land use on hurricane-harvey-induced flooding in houston area,LAND,"Hurricane harvey (2017) caused widespread flash flooding by extremely heavy rainfall and resulted in tremendous damage, including 82 fatalities and huge economic loss in the houston, texas area. To reduce hazards, loss, and to improve urban resilience, it is important to understand the factors that influence the occurrence of flooding events. People rely on natural resources and different land uses to reduce the severity of flood impacts and mitigate the risk. In this study, we focused the impacts of land use on hurricane-harvey-induced flooding inside and outside the houston city center. With the recent trend that more citizen scientists serve in delivering information about natural disaster response, local residents in houston areas participated in delineating the flooded areas in hurricane harvey. The flooding information used here generated a published map with citizen-contributed flooding data. A regional model framework with spatial autocovariates was employed to understand those interactions. Different land use patterns and types affected the potential of flooding events differently inside and outside houston's city center. Explicitly, we found agricultural and open space were associated with high risk of flooding outside the city center, industrial lands increased the high risk of flooding in city center, and residential areas reduced the potential of flooding both inside and outside the city center. The results can assist with future land use strategy in houston and other areas, and mitigate potential flash flooding. This study also highlighted the contribution of citizen science to responses to natural hazards.",LAND USE; HURRICANE HARVEY; FLOODING; CITIZEN SCIENCE; SPATIAL MODEL; HOUSTON,TEMPORAL VARIABILITY; POTENTIAL IMPACT; OPEN SPACE; COVER; INDEX; PRECIPITATION; DRAINAGE; DURATION; DAMAGES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,none,"YANG, D (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV FLORIDA, DEPT GEOG, GAINESVILLE, FL 32611 USA.;YANG, D (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV FLORIDA, LAND USE \& ENVIRONM CHANGE INST, GAINESVILLE, FL 32611 USA.;YANG, DI, YANG, ANNI, HERRERO, HANNAH, FU, CHIUNG-SHIVAN, UNIV FLORIDA, DEPT GEOG, GAINESVILLE, FL 32611 USA.;YANG, DI, HERRERO, HANNAH, FU, CHIUNG-SHIVAN, UNIV FLORIDA, LAND USE \& ENVIRONM CHANGE INST, GAINESVILLE, FL 32611 USA.;QIU, HAN, MICHIGAN STATE UNIV, DEPT CIVIL \& ENVIRONM ENGN, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA.;ZHOU, YAO, UNIV CENT FLORIDA, NATL CTR INTEGRATED COASTAL RES, SCH PUBL ADM, ORLANDO, FL 32816 USA.;YU, QIANG, BEIJING FORESTRY UNIV, BEIJING KEY LAB PRECIS FORESTRY, BEIJING 100083, PEOPLES R CHINA.;TANG, JINGYIN, IBM CORP, WEATHER CO, ATLANTA, GA 30319 USA.",10.3390/LAND8020025,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,,,,2,,MDPI,8,2019,ISI000460795000004,64,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,5,ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES,YANGDI1031UFL.EDU YANGANN1UFL.EDU QIUHANMSU.EDU YAO.ZHOUUCF.EDU HVHERREROUFL.EDU CSFUUFL.EDU YUGIANGBJFU.EDU.CN JINGYIN.TANGIBM.COM,,HO3CF,,"YANG, D (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV FLORIDA, DEPT GEOG, GAINESVILLE, FL 32611 USA",ISI,UNIV FLORIDA;UNIV FLORIDA;MICHIGAN STATE UNIV;UNIV CENT FLORIDA;BEIJING FORESTRY UNIV,UNIV FLORIDA,,"YANG D, 2019, LAND","YANG D, 2019, LAND",TRUE,0,3,1,0,0,0,2_3_5_16,1,2

This article introduces the evacuation vehicle routing problem (evrp) as a new variant to the vehicle routing problem (vrp). Evrp is a process of moving vehicles from a vehicle location to the potentially flooded area (pfa), and from pfa to relief center using a number of capacitated vehicles. This paper examines the application of a multi-valued discrete particle swarm optimization (dpso) for routing of vehicles from vehicle location to pfa. A solution representation is adopted and modified from the solution of the shortest path problem (spp) to accommodate this problem. Experimental results were tested based on the objective function of finding a minimum total travelling time using datasets from a flash flood evacuation operation. Dpso was found to yield better results than a genetic algorithm (ga).",DISCRETE PARTICLE SWARM OPTIMIZATION; EVACUATION ROUTE PLAN; EVACUATION VEHICLE ROUTING PROBLEM; POTENTIALLY FLOODED AREA; VEHICLE ROUTING PROBLEM,TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM; ALGORITHM,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,3,"AI TJ, 2009, COMPUT IND ENG, V56, P380, DOI 10.1016/J.CIE.2008.06.012.;AL-KAZEMI B, 2005, ADV INFORM KNOWL PRO, P305, DOI 10.1007/1-84628-117-2\_20.;ALHAJRI MF, 2007, CAN CON EL COMP EN, P1286.;BUI LT, 2007, LECT NOTES ARTIF INT, V4828, P333.;EBERHART R.

Planning for disaster relief is important in rescuing victims with the involvement of many agencies and the public in managing the event. This is due to poor coordination, late assistance and uneven distribution of vehicles, food, and medical assistants. Time and cost are very important in disaster relief. The need for a proper disaster relief plan to overcome these issues is crucial. This paper presents a two tier solutions to relieve flood victims focuses on the evacuation. The first tier is to complete the task of vehicles assignment at the inundated area. Then, the routing of vehicles from inundated areas to relief centres.

508,Chen N;Yao S;Wang C;Du W,A method for urban flood risk assessment and zoning considering road environments and terrain,SUSTAINABILITY,"Floods have been severely threatening social development worldwide. The occurrence of floods has multiple factors, and the flood risk considering road environments needs comprehensive analysis from meteorology, underlying surface, and urban road network. Thus, this study proposes an integrated method and constructs a road risk zoning model (rrzm). In the rrzm, submerged depth was obtained by the soil conservation service (scs) model, and the degree of road importance was obtained by the analytical hierarchy process (ahp) method. These two parts were used to characterize road vulnerability. Then the flood risk grade was evaluated based on the optimized artificial neural network (ann). Finally, the results of flood risk assessment were obtained by road vulnerability and flood risk grade. The rrzm was applied to the chang-zhu-tan urban agglomeration (cztua), china. The results showed that the spatial distributions of flood risk and the extent of road damage varied remarkably in different cities. Changsha was the most sensitive city to floods in the cztua. The flood risk zones were classified into six levels, and the vulnerable road sections identified from the risk zones at level 6 in the maps carried more traffic volume than others. By comparing with existing methods, it was found that the rrzm effectively reflected the spatial characteristics of flood risk considering road environments. It provides a new perspective for urban flood risk assessment and disaster response decision-making.",URBAN FLOOD; ROAD ENVIRONMENTS; FLOOD RISK ASSESSMENT; ROAD RISK ZONING MODEL; CHANG-ZHU-TAN URBAN AGGLOMERATION,HUAIHE RIVER-BASIN; ASSESSMENT MODEL; FLASH-FLOOD; NETWORK; CLIMATE; CITY; VULNERABILITY; SENSITIVITY; IMPACTS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"WANG, C (REPRINT AUTHOR), WUHAN UNIV, STATE KEY LAB INFORMAT ENGN SURVEYING MAPPING \& R, WUHAN 430079, HUBEI, PEOPLES R CHINA.;CHEN, NENGCHENG, YAO, SHUANG, WANG, CHAO, DU, WENYING, WUHAN UNIV, STATE KEY LAB INFORMAT ENGN SURVEYING MAPPING \& R, WUHAN 430079, HUBEI, PEOPLES R CHINA.;CHEN, NENGCHENG, COLLABORAT INNOVAT CTR GEOSPATIAL TECHNOL, 129 LUOYU RD, WUHAN 430079, HUBEI, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.3390/SU11102734,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,NATIONAL KEY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM OF CHINA [2017YFB0503803]; NATIONAL NATURE SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA (NSFC) PROGRAMNATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [41601406]; CHINA POSTDOCTORAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONCHINA POSTDOCTORAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION [2017M622502]; CRSRI OPEN RESEARCH PROGRAM [CKWV2018487/KY],,2071-1050,10,,MDPI,11,2019,ISI000471010300017,44,"SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY",11,"GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES",CNCWHU.EDU.CN YAOSHUANGWHU.EDU.CN C.WANGWHU.EDU.CN DUWENYINGWHU.EDU.CN,,IC5LV,,"WANG, C (REPRINT AUTHOR), WUHAN UNIV, STATE KEY LAB INFORMAT ENGN SURVEYING MAPPING \& R, WUHAN 430079, HUBEI, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,WUHAN UNIV;COLLABORAT INNOVAT CTR GEOSPATIAL TECHNOL,WUHAN UNIV,,"CHEN N, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY","CHEN N, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY",FALSE,2,7,1,0,0,6,2_4_11,1,1

The increasing popularity of social media, micro-blogging services and ubiquitous availability of high-resolution smartphone cameras with pervasive connectivity are propelling our digital footprints and cyber activities. Such online human footprints related with an event-of-interest, if mined appropriately, can provide meaningful information to analyze the current course and pre- and post-impact leading to the organizational planning of various real-time smart city applications. In this paper, we investigate the narrative (texts) and visual (images) components of twitter feeds to improve the results of queries by exploiting the deep contexts of each data modality. We employ latent semantic analysis (lsa)-based techniques to analyze the texts and discrete cosine transformation (dct) to analyze the images which help establish the cross-correlations between the textual and image dimensions of a query. While each of the data dimensions helps improve the results of a specific query on its own, the contributions from the dual modalities can potentially provide insights that are greater than what can be obtained from the individual modalities. We validate our proposed approach using real twitter feeds from a recent devastating flash flood in ellicott city near the university of maryland campus.

456,Shannag Fb;Hammo Bh,Lessons learned from event detection from arabic tweets: the case of jordan flash floods near dead sea,2019 IEEE JORDAN INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (JEEIT),"Event detection is essential for decision makers to understand the events surrounding their real world. Social media microblogging platforms play a significant role in our life. One of these platforms is twitter, which has an extreme high exchange rate and accordingly has become a valuable and relevant source for many political and social events. Event detection from social media attracted the attention of researchers in different natural languages. Extracting and detecting events from arabic tweets is still under investigation. In this paper, we have used the python natural language toolkit (nltk) library to develop two classifiers for filtering and detecting extracted events from arabic tweets. The first classifier filters the collected tweets using two passes. The first pass identifies the hashtags while the second pass does a shallow analysis on the tweets content. The second classifier analyzes the text extracted from the tweets. As a case study, we present the tragic events of the jordan flash floods near the dead sea. The model successfully filtered all the collected tweets and picked the ones describing the incidents within that region. Analyzed data revealed important information to learn from this lesson for the future. The solution can be generalized and adapted to other problems.",EVENTS; DETECTION; TWITTER; ARABIC; CLASSIFICATION,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,none,"SHANNAG, FB (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV JORDAN, KING ABDULLAH II SCH INFORMAT TECHNOL, AMMAN, JORDAN.;SHANNAG, FATIMA B., HAMMO, BASSAM H., UNIV JORDAN, KING ABDULLAH II SCH INFORMAT TECHNOL, AMMAN, JORDAN.",,"345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017 USA","JABER, KM",,978-1-5386-7942-5,,,806-811,IEEE,,2019,ISI000470894100149,21,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, ENGINEERING",2,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, ENGINEERING, ELECTRICAL \& ELECTRONIC",FATIMASHANNAGYAHOO.COM B.HATNMOJU.EDU.JO,,BM9FT,2019 IEEE JORDAN INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (JEEIT),"SHANNAG, FB (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV JORDAN, KING ABDULLAH II SCH INFORMAT TECHNOL, AMMAN, JORDAN",ISI,UNIV JORDAN,UNIV JORDAN,,"SHANNAG FB, 2019, 2019 IEEE JORDAN INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (JEEIT)","SHANNAG FB, 2019, 2019 IEEE JORDAN INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ELECTRICAL ENGINEERING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (JEEIT)",FALSE,0,0,0,0,1,0,2_7_16,0,1
17,Gariano Sl;Guzzetti F,Landslides in a changing climate,EARTH-SCIENCE REVIEWS,"Warming of the earth climate system is unequivocal. That climate changes affect the stability of natural and engineered slopes and have consequences on landslides, is also undisputable. Less clear is the type, extent, magnitude and direction of the changes in the stability conditions, and on the location, abundance, activity and frequency of landslides in response to the projected climate changes. Climate and landslides act at only partially overlapping spatial and temporal scales, complicating the evaluation of the climate impacts on landslides. We review the literature on landslide-climate studies, and find a bias in their geographical distribution, with large parts of the world not investigated. We recommend to fill the gap with new studies in asia, south america, and africa. We examine advantages and limits of the approaches adopted to evaluate the effects of climate variations on landslides, including prospective modelling and retrospective methods that use landslide and climate records. We consider changes in temperature, precipitation, wind and weather systems, and their direct and indirect effects on the stability of single slopes, and we use a probabilistic landslide hazard model to appraise regional landslide changes. Our review indicates that the modelling results of landslide-climate studies depend more on the emission scenarios, the global circulation models, and the methods to downscale the climate variables, than on the description of the variables controlling slope processes. We advocate for constructing ensembles of projections based on a range of emissions scenarios, and to use carefully results from worst-case scenarios that may over/under-estimate landslide hazards and risk. We further advocate that uncertainties in the landslide projections must be quantified and communicated to decision makers and the public. We perform a preliminary global assessment of the future landslide impact, and we present a global map of the projected impact of climate change on landslide activity and abundance. Where global warming is expected to increase the frequency and intensity of severe rainfall events, a primary trigger of rapid-moving landslides that cause many landslide fatalities, we predict an increase in the number of people exposed to landslide risk. Finally, we give recommendations for landslide adaptation and risk reduction strategies in the framework of a warming climate. (C) 2016 the author. Published by elsevier b.v.

90,Nahiduzzaman Km;Aldosary As;Rahman Mt,Flood induced vulnerability in strategic plan making process of riyadh city,HABITAT INTERNATIONAL,"Riyadh, the capital of saudi arabia, is undergoing a critical transition when the conventionally thought desert climate has been witnessing `turning-to-be-regular' flash floods. Since 2009, the city has been repeatedly hit by flash floods that has put further adverse consequences on the properties and even resulting in death tolls. Such critical transition has made the think-tanks seriously re-think about the resilient capacity of the existing infrastructure. Although the city has been attempted to plan, develop and expand under a number of master planning regimes, the `emerging-recurrent' flash flood was not critically considered in the plan making process. However, the recent medstar comprehensive strategic development initiative has brought a new hope with re-conceptualizing the planning strategies in the plan making and revision processes. Thus, this study attempts to evaluate the credibility of master plans with an especial focus on medstar to find out the resilience power against flash flood driven adverse consequences. The evaluation is carried out with the lens of social and physical vulnerabilities of flash floods and associated risks of the proposed strategies for growth and land use of riyadh until 2030. The evaluation suggests that many areas of riyadh city, formally proposed with specific land uses, densification and expansion plan, are prone to both social and physical vulnerabilities of flood in the scale of `high' to `moderate' vulnerability induced risks. With the aid of composite flood vulnerability (social and physical) index, therefore, this study suggests medstar comprehensive development strategy to undergo another re-evaluation process that perhaps will strongly influence the current investment decision on infrastructure to make riyadh resilient against the `emerging-recurrent' flash floods.

113,Aroca-Jimenez E;Maria Bodoque J;Antonio Garcia J;Diez-Herrero A,Construction of an integrated social vulnerability index in urban areas prone to flash flooding,NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"Among the natural hazards, flash flooding is the leading cause of weather-related deaths. Flood risk management (frm) in this context requires a comprehensive assessment of the social risk component. In this regard, integrated social vulnerability (isv) can incorporate spatial distribution and contribution and the combined effect of exposure, sensitivity and resilience to total vulnerability, although these components are often disregarded. Isv is defined by the demographic and socio-economic characteristics that condition a population's capacity to cope with, resist and recover from risk and can be expressed as the integrated social vulnerability index (isvi). This study describes a methodological approach towards constructing the isvi in urban areas prone to flash flooding in castilla y leon (castile and leon, northern central spain, 94 223 km(2), 2 478 376 inhabitants). A hierarchical segmentation analysis (hsa) was performed prior to the principal components analysis (pca), which helped to overcome the sample size limitation inherent in pca. Isvi was obtained from weighting vulnerability factors based on the tolerance statistic. In addition, latent class cluster analysis (lcca) was carried out to identify spatial patterns of vulnerability within the study area. Our results show that the isvi has high spatial variability. Moreover, the source of vulnerability in each urban area cluster can be identified from lcca. These findings make it possible to design tailor-made strategies for frm, thereby increasing the efficiency of plans and policies and helping to reduce the cost of mitigation measures.",,RISK-MANAGEMENT; ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RESILIENCE; FRAMEWORK; MODEL; ADAPTATION; DISASTERS; CONTEXT; EUROPE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,7,"ADGER W.

199,Aroca-Jimenez E;Bodoque Jm;Garcia Ja;Diez-Herrero A,A quantitative methodology for the assessment of the regional economic vulnerability to flash floods,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Economic losses caused by flash floods are expected to rise worldwide in the coming decades, which is largely due to the increasing exposure of elements at risk. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the economic context of the potentially affected areas is highly recommendable. Numerous papers have been published to date that focus on quantifying vulnerability in general and in areas affected by floods in particular. However, the number of studies devoted to flash flood-prone areas is far lower. Integrated economic vulnerability assessment enables one to learn what characteristics explain, trigger, intensify, and attenuate the exposure, sensitivity, and resilience of economically vulnerable populations, which can be combined to achieve an integrated economic vulnerability index (ievi). The methodology deployed here was conducted in castilla y leon (northwest spain, 94.223 km(2)) and has allowed the economic vulnerability of urban areas to be analyzed, which has been primarily addressed by the estimation of economic losses or, more recently, including a few economic variables within social vulnerability assessments. Thus, 118 economic variables were initially gathered and then divided into groups through a hierarchical segmentation analysis. Subsequently, variables were combined employing a principal components analysis, giving rise to the economic vulnerability factors that were subsequently aggregated to construct the ievi. Tolerance statistic was used as a weighting method to define the ievi, whereas quintiles were chosen as a statistical criterion to map economic vulnerability. As a final step, latent class cluster analysis was implemented to identify spatial patterns of vulnerability. Our findings show that ievi scores have a high spatial variability and a high degree of complexity in the relationships among different vulnerability factors. Moreover, they help to identify spatial patterns of vulnerability, which makes the design of suitable vulnerability reduction strategies possible, thereby improving the efficiency of flood risk management plans and policies.",ECONOMIC VULNERABILITY; VULNERABILITY INDEX; FLASH FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT; SPATIAL PATTERNS; LATENT CLASS CLUSTER ANALYSIS,SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; RISK-MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE; MOUNTAIN HAZARDS; ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS; COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; NATURAL DISASTERS; URBAN AREAS; FRAMEWORK; INDEX,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"ADGER WN, 2006, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V16, P268, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2006.02.006.;ADGER WN, 1999, WORLD DEV, V27, P249, DOI 10.1016/S0305-750X(98)00136-3.;AROCA-JIMENEZ E, 2017, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V17, P1541, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-17-1541-2017.;BAKKENSEN LA, 2017, RISK ANAL, V37, P982, DOI 10.1111/RISA.12677.;BALTEANU D, 2015, INT MULTI SCI GEOCO, P577.;BARNETT J, 2008, ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR, V98, P102, DOI 10.1080/00045600701734315.;BARREDO JI, 2007, NAT HAZARDS, V42, P125, DOI 10.1007/S11069-006-9065-2.;BIRKMANN J, 2013, NAT HAZARDS, V67, P193, DOI 10.1007/S11069-013-0558-5.;BODOQUE JM, 2016, J HYDROL, V541, P665, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2016.02.005.;BODOQUE JM, 2015, J HYDROL, V529, P449, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2014.12.004.;BORGA M., 2013, DATING TORRENTIAL PR, P424, DOI [10.1007/978-94-007-4336-627, DOI 10.1007/978-94-007-4336-627].;CHAKRABORTY J, 2005, NAT HAZARDS REV, V6, P23, DOI DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)1527-6988(2005)6:1(23).;CREUTIN JD, 2009, METEOROL APPL, V16, P115, DOI 10.1002/MET.128.;CUTTER SL, 2013, J FLOOD RISK MANAG, V6, P332, DOI 10.1111/JFR3.12018.;CUTTER SL, 2003, SOC SCI QUART, V84, P242, DOI 10.1111/1540-6237.8402002.;CUTTER SL, 2010, J HOMEL SECUR EMERG, V7.;CUTTER SL, 2008, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V18, P598, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2008.07.013.;DANA M, 2015, INT MULTI SCI GEOCO, P317.;DEBORTOLI NS, 2017, NAT HAZARDS, V86, P557, DOI 10.1007/S11069-016-2705-2.;DELGADO J.

As a result, urban planning areas are susceptible and vulnerable to different types of natural disasters, which cause extensive damages to these areas. In the current study, for the protection of the urban environment, a unique approach of urban planning and sustainable development is proposed. The study area is the wadi al-aska basin (east of jeddah city), saudi arabia. Before the suitability analysis, urban development in the jeddah area from 1973 to 2009 was applied. In the current study, an integrated evaluation of the suitable areas for urban development is proposed by using geological, geomorphological, and geographical characteristics of the study area as well as flash flood hazard factor. The used parameters were correlated by using the analytical hierarchical process (ahp) method and incorporated into a geographic information system (gis) in order to produce the corresponding suitability maps. The study area is classified into five categories including very high, high, moderate, low, and very low suitability for urban development. These can be attributed mainly to the fact that in the majority of cases, only geographical, social, and economical factors were used for urban development, whereas in the current study, geomorphological, geographical, geological, and natural hazards parameters were quantified and taken into account.",URBAN GEOLOGY; LAND-USE PLANNING; AHP; GIS; KSA,GIS; VULNERABILITY; MODEL; RISK,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,6,"ALEHAIDEB S, 1985, THESIS ARIZONA STATE.;ALY MH, 2005, ENVIRON ENG GEOSCI, V11, P259, DOI 10.2113/11.3.259.;AYALEW L, 2005, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V65, P15, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2004.06.010.;BANTAYAN NC, 1998, LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN, V43, P35, DOI 10.1016/S0169-2046(98)00101-7.;BATHRELLOS GD, 2009, ESTUD GEOL-MADRID, V65, P49, DOI 10.3989/EGEOL.08642.036.;BATHRELLOS GD, 2012, ENVIRON EARTH SCI, V66, P537, DOI 10.1007/S12665-011-1263-X.;BEINAT E, 1998, MULTICRITERIA ANAL L, P227, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-94-015-9058-7\_.;CHAKHAR S, 2008, INT J GEOGR INF SCI, V22, P1159, DOI 10.1080/13658810801949827.;DAI FC, 2001, ENG GEOL, V61, P257, DOI 10.1016/S0013-7952(01)00028-X.;DONG J, 2008, SENSORS-BASEL, V8, P5975, DOI 10.3390/S8095975.;EASTMAN JR, 1995, PHOTOGRAMM ENG REM S, V61, P539.;EYLES N, 1997, GEOLOGICAL ASS CANAD, V3, P1.;FEDESKI M, 2007, LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN, V83, P50, DOI 10.1016/J.LANDURBPLAN.2007.05.012.;KANGAS J, 1993, FOREST ECOL MANAG, V59, P271, DOI 10.1016/0378-1127(93)90007-A.;KLAUS DG, 2013, P INT S AN HIER PROC.;MALCZEWSKI J, 1999, GIS MULTICRITERIA DE.;MARINONI O, 2004, COMPUT GEOSCI-UK, V30, P637, DOI 10.1016/J.CAGEO.2004.03.010.;MENDOZA G A., 1997, P 1997 ACSM ASPRS AN, V4, P130.;MOHAMMAD AM, 2006, J ALAM BINA, V8, P1.;PEEL MC, 2007, HYDROL EARTH SYST SC, V11, P1633, DOI 10.5194/HESS-11-1633-2007.;PUKKALA T, 1996, FOREST SCI, V42, P198.;RAO KHVD, 2005, LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN, V71, P163, DOI 10.1016/J.LANDURBPLAN.2004.03.001.;ROZOS D, 2011, ENVIRON EARTH SCI, V63, P49, DOI 10.1007/S12665-010-0687-Z.;SAATY T.

On this day, 124.5 mm of rain fell within 3 h (monthly mean: 29.3 mm) triggering a flash flood that inundated at least 0.4 km(2) of urban settlements along the channel, affecting more than 280 buildings, 23 of a total of 53 bridges (pedestrian, vehicle and railway), and leading to the partial collapse of sections of the main road, paralyzing central parts of the city for more than one week. This study assesses the aspects of building design and site specific environmental characteristics that render a building vulnerable by considering the example of a flash flood event in february 2013. A statistical methodology is developed that enables estimation of damage probability for buildings. The applied method uses observed inundation height as a hazard proxy in areas where more detailed hydrodynamic modeling data is not available. Building design and site-specific environmental conditions determine the physical vulnerability. The mathematical approach considers both physical vulnerability and hazard related parameters and helps to reduce uncertainty in the determination of descriptive parameters, parameter interdependency and respective contributions to damage. This study aims to (1) enable the estimation of damage probability for a certain hazard intensity, and (2) obtain data to visualize variations in damage susceptibility for buildings in flood prone areas. Data collection is based on a post-flood event field survey and the analysis of high (sub-metric) spatial resolution images (pleiades 2012, 2013). An inventory of 30 city blocks was collated in a gis database in order to estimate the physical vulnerability of buildings. As many as 1103 buildings were surveyed along the affected drainage and 898 buildings were included in the statistical analysis. Univariate and bivariate analyses were applied to better characterize each vulnerability parameter. Multiple corresponding analyses revealed strong relationships between the ``distance to channel or bridges, ``structural building type, ``building footprint and the observed damage. Logistic regression enabled quantification of the contribution of each explanatory parameter to potential damage, and determination of the significant parameters that express the damage susceptibility of a building. The model was applied 200 times on different calibration and validation data sets in order to examine performance. Results show that 90\% of these tests have a success rate of more than 67\%. Probabilities (at building scale) of experiencing different damage levels during a future event similar to the 8 february 2013 flash flood are the major outcomes of this study. (C) 2015 elsevier b.v.

Firstly, a relational database was created in order to collect all necessary information available. Secondly, hazard maps were drawn based on an innovative approach of assessing the magnitude and frequency of meteorological hazard types, where the corresponding formalization was not yet satisfying. Thirdly, the associated economic losses were evaluated and presented in monetary terms for some hazard types (droughts, hurricanes, hail, frost, flash floods and earthquakes), while for other types of hazards, the information remained descriptive. Fourthly, based on the hazard inventory, an approach was developed that allowed for the calculation of an overall vulnerability value for each individual hazard type, using the gross domestic product per unit area (applied to population) as the indicator for elements at risk exposed. The correlation between estimated economic losses, physical exposure and the magnitude for each of the six types of hazards has been investigated in detail by using multiple linear regression analysis. Economic losses for all past events were estimated, and historical vulnerability was estimated. Finally, the spatial distribution of general vulnerability was assessed, and the expected maximum economic loss was calculated as well as a multi-risk map was set-up. The presented method will contribute to a reduction of disaster losses in georgia and will foster future efforts of harmonization of risk management strategies in the country.",VULNERABILITY; HISTORICAL CATALOGUE; HAZARD; ECONOMIC LOSS; RISK,SNOW AVALANCHE RISK; PHYSICAL VULNERABILITY; SUSCEPTIBILITY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,15,"ABDUSHELISHVILI KL, 1984, KADASTR LAVIN SSSR Z, V9, P108.;ABDUSHELISHVILI KL, 1983, OPASNIE GIDRO METEOR, P3.;ABDUSHELISHVILI KL, 1986, T VESEOUZNOGO SOVESH, P198.;ABDUSHELISHVILI KL, 1999, T ZAKNIGMI, V88, P71.;ABDUSHELISHVILI KL, 1997, ATLAS SNEJHNO LEDOVI, P92.;ADPC, 2000, COURS MAT URB DIS MI.;ALLEN M, 2004, TECTONICS, V23, DOI 10.1029/2003TC001530.;AMIRANASHVILI A, 2008, T I HYDROMETEOROLOGY, V115, P427.;AMIRANASHVILI A, 2002, T I HYDROMETEOROLOGY, V108, P249.;AMIRANASHVILI A, 2009, P INT S FLOODS MOD M, P28.;[ANONYMOUS], 2006, VULNERABILITY CONCEP, P[48, 8].;[ANONYMOUS], 1965, SEISM INT SCAL VERS.;ATLAS, 2012, ATL NAT HAZ RISKS GE.;BALASSANIAN S, 1999, ANN GEOFIS, V42, P1139.;BARBOLINI M, 2004, MANAG INFORMAT SYST, V9, P533.;BARREDO JI, 2007, NAT HAZARDS, V42, P125, DOI 10.1007/S11069-006-9065-2.;BENSON C, 2000, MANAGING DISASTER RI, P11.;BIRKMANN J., 2006, MEASURING VULNERABIL, V1, P9, DOI DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6975.;BLAIKIE P, 1994, RISK NATURAL HAZARDS.;BRUNDL M., 2010, GEOMORPHOLOGICAL HAZ, P49.;CHACHAVA N, 2001, NATURAL DISASTERS DE, P81.;CHELIDZE T, 2009, NATO SCI PEACE SEC, V52, P11, DOI 10.3233/978-1-58603-948-6-11.;CHITANAVA R, 2009, P INT S FLOODS MOD M.;COBURN A., 1991, VULNERABILITY RISK A.;COROMINAS J, 2005, LANDSLIDES, V2, P343, DOI 10.1007/S10346-005-0022-Z.;CUTTER SL, 1996, PROG HUM GEOG, V20, P529, DOI 10.1177/030913259602000407.;CUTTER SL, 2008, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V105, P2301, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.0710375105.;DAO H., 2004, GLOBAL EVALUATION HU, V1, P435.;DAO H, 2003, GLOBAL RISK VULNERAB.;DEMETS C, 1990, GEOPHYS J INT, V101, P425, DOI 10.1111/J.1365-246X.1990.TB06579.X.;DILLEY M, 2005, DISAST RISK MANAGE, P1.;DOLIDZE J, 2007, ATLAS GIS BASED MAPS, P15.;DOLIDZE J, 2009, P INT S FLOODS MOD M, P115.;DOUGLAS J, 2007, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V7, P283, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-7-283-2007.;DOWNTON M.

352,Marjerison Rd;Walter Mt;Sullivan Pj;Colucci Sj,Does population affect the location of flash flood reports?,JOURNAL OF APPLIED METEOROLOGY AND CLIMATOLOGY,"Flash floods cause more fatalities than any other weather-related natural hazard and cause significant damage to property and infrastructure. It is important to understand the underlying processes that lead to these infrequent but high-consequence events. Accurately determining the locations of flash flood events can be difficult, which impedes comprehensive research of the phenomena. While some flash floods can be detected by automated means (e.g., streamflow gauges), flash floods (and other severe weather events) are generally based on human observations and may not reflect the actual distribution of event locations. The storm data-storm events database, which is produced from national weather service reports, was used to locate reported flash floods within the forecast area of the binghamton, new york, weather forecast office between 2007 and 2013. The distribution of those reports was analyzed as a function of environmental variables associated with flood generation including slope, impervious area, soil saturated hydraulic conductivity k(sat), representative rainfall intensity, and representative rainfall depth, as well as human population. A spatial conditional autoregressive model was used to test the hypothesis that flash flood reports are made more frequently in areas with higher populations, even when other flood-generating processes are considered. Slope, soil saturated hydraulic conductivity, and impervious area are significant predictors of flash flood reports. When population is added as a predictor, the model is similarly robust, but impervious area and k(sat) are no longer significant predictors.

Qena is one of the most egyptian governorates prone to flash floods. Various flash floods events hit qena from 1954 till 2016. Flash floods occurred in qena on 28th october 2016 inundated houses and roads, generated losses in lives, damages to private and public property. The intensive rainfall coupled with the rapid urban expansion in qena and along the nile valley could worsen the situation. Despite, the destructive impacts of the flash floods in qena, flash floods can be used as a valuable source of fresh water as the study area is classified as an arid zone and characterized with the fresh-water shortage. Integration of remotely sensed data with the analytical hierarchy process and geographic information systems spatial modeling presented valuable analysis techniques in this study. The present study focused on mapping the spatial distribution of flash floods vulnerability in qena's urban areas. Ten indicators were used to analyze the flood floods namely, rainfall, soil, geology, slope, elevation, flow direction, drainage network, land cover, total population, and population density. The results revealed that qena, qus, naqadah, and dishna urban districts are the most vulnerable to flash floods and located in the very high zone with 25.3\%, 14.9\%, 12.3\%, and 9.8\% respectively. The total population situated at very high and high vulnerability zone reached represents 7.66\% and 43.36\% of the total population. The obtained results considered crucial information for decision-makers for future effective flash floods hazards mitigation, assessment management, planning, and sustainable development.",,RAS GHARIB CITY; RED-SEA; VULNERABILITY; RISK,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,none,"MOHAMED, SA (REPRINT AUTHOR), MHESR, HITHC, CAIRO, EGYPT.;MOHAMED, SOHA A., MHESR, HITHC, CAIRO, EGYPT.",10.1016/J.JAFREARSCI.2019.05.015,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",,,,1464-343X,,,PERGAMON-ELSEVIER SCIENCE LTD,158,2019,ISI000483456700033,56,GEOLOGY,31,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY",IGSR.SOHA.AHMEDALEXU.EDU.EG,,IU3CQ,,"MOHAMED, SA (REPRINT AUTHOR), MHESR, HITHC, CAIRO, EGYPT",ISI,,NOTREPORTED,,"MOHAMED SA, 2019, J AFR EARTH SCI","MOHAMED SA, 2019, J AFR EARTH SCI",TRUE,0,0,2,0,0,0,3_11_17,1,2

Health impacts from cyclones and tropical storms cause acute injuries and infectious disease outbreaks. Defining population vulnerability to extreme weather events by examining a recent flood in honiara, solomon islands, can help stakeholders and policymakers adapt development to reduce future threats. The acute and subacute health impacts following the april 2014 floods were defined using data obtained from hospitals and clinics, the ministry of health and in-country world health organization office in honiara. Geographical information system (gis) was used to assess morbidity and mortality, and vulnerability of the health system infrastructure and households in honiara. The april flash floods were responsible for 21 acute deaths, 33 injuries, and a diarrhea outbreak that affected 8,584 people with 10 pediatric deaths. A gis vulnerability assessment of the location of the health system infrastructure and households relative to rivers and the coastline identified 75\% of the health infrastructure and over 29\% of honiara's population as vulnerable to future hydrological events. Honiara, solomon islands, is a rapidly growing, highly vulnerable urban pacific island environment. Evaluation of the mortality and morbidity from the april 2014 floods as well as the infectious disease outbreaks that followed allows public health specialists and policy makers to understand the health system and populations vulnerability to future shocks. Understanding the negative impacts natural disaster have on people living in urban pacific environments will help the government as well as development partners in crafting resilient adaptation development.",,SOUTH-PACIFIC; DISASTER; IMPACT,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"ADB, 2015, CORP EV STUD ADB SUP.;ADB, 2015, AS DEV BANK SOL ISL.;ALDERMAN K, 2013, DISASTER MED PUBLIC, V7, P380, DOI 10.1017/DMP.2013.42.;ALLIANCE DEVELOPMENT WORKS AND UNITED NATIONS UNIVERSITY INSTITUTE FOR ENVIRONMENT AND HUMAN SECURITY, 2014, WORLD RISK REP 2014.;ARIMA Y, 2015, WEST PAC SURVEILL RE, V6, DOI [10.5365/WPSAR.2014.5.4.002, 10.5365/WPSAR.2014.5.4.002].;AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF METEOROLOGY (BOM) AND COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH ORGANIZATION, 2014, CLIM VAR EXTR CHANG.;AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF METEOROLOGY COMMONWEALTH SCIENTIFIC AND INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH ORGANISATION, 2012, CLIM CHANG PAC SCI A, V2.;BANNISTER-TYRRELL M, 2013, AM J TROP MED HYG, V88, P65, DOI 10.4269/AJTMH.2012.11-0451.;BARROS VR, 2014, CLIMATE CHANGE 2014, P688, DOI DOI 10.1017/CBO9781107415324.004.;BLONG RJ, 1993, DISASTERS, V17, P1, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-7717.1993.TB00483.X.;BRITTON NR, 1987, DISASTERS, V11, P120, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-7717.1987.TB00627.X.;BURKI T, 2015, LANCET, V386, P843, DOI 10.1016/S0140-6736(15)00004-5.;CANN KF, 2013, EPIDEMIOL INFECT, V141, P671, DOI 10.1017/S0950268812001653.;CAO-LORMEAU VM, 2014, EMERG INFECT DIS, V20, P1034, DOI 10.3201/EID2006.131413.;D'AUBERT A, 2012, FURIOUS WINDS PARCHE.;FERNANDEZ A, 2015, PLOS ONE, V10, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PONE.0119929.;FIELD C.

In this event incurred heavy losses to the infrastructure, agricultural fields, human and animal lives, roads and widespread destruction of natural resources. Disaster of such a magnitude of disaster was perhaps not experienced by the region at least over the last 100 years. Thus, this disaster can be considered as an extreme climatic event of the century. The extent and intensity of the tragedy can easily be visualised by the fact that all the famous shrines of the uttarakhand state are located in high mountainous, snowbound areas. These places, badrinath (3133 m asl in alaknanda valley), kedarnath (3584 m asl in mandakini valley), gangotri (3140 m asl in bhagirathi valley), yamunotri (3291 m asl in yamuna valley) and hemkund sahib (4433 m asl in alaknanda valley), were badly affected by this extreme fury of the nature. In this paper we cover the devastated area that lies in the bhagirathi river valley, which forms a part of uttarkashi, tehri and pauri districts in the lesser and higher himalayas, garhwal. During the field observation, we have collected a total number of 4955 points in the bhagirathi valley, these points are points of interest (poi) (2084), damage to bridges and culverts (44), landslides (1034), eroded land cover and natural resource (92), riverbank erosion (170), damage to roads (494), damage to other infrastructures (320) and damage to buildings (717).

This paper describes the process of mapping Texas’ swift water rescues as the first step in building a GIS that could be used to analyze the relationship between flash floods, low water crossings and swift water rescues. This effort was undertaken in association with the Texas Department of State Health Services, utilizing a team of undergraduates in an upper division GIS class to perform the mapping. The research focused on a single year – 2007 – because in that year Texas suffered the most flash flood deaths in the nation. While numerous data issues were encountered, eventually 675 (88 percent) of the 767 swift water rescues recorded by the State Fire Marshall’s office for that year were successfully mapped, resulting in the first such map ever produced for the region.",,UNITED-STATES; MORTALITY,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,1,"ASHLEY ST, 2008, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V47, P805, DOI 10.1175/2007JAMC1611.1.;BORDEN KA, 2008, INT J HEALTH GEOGR, V7, DOI 10.1186/1476-072X-7-64.;FRENCH J, 1983, PUBLIC HEALTH REP, V98, P584.;GEORGAKAKOS KP, 1986, B AM METEOROL SOC, V67, P1233, DOI 10.1175/1520-0477(1986)067<1233:OTDONR>2.0.CO,2.;GOERL R.

Understanding the spatiotemporal characteristics of flash floods can help emergency managers and stakeholders in devising solutions to mitigate the associated risks and damages. In this study, a data-driven approach is employed to characterize flash flood hazard across the contiguous united states (conus). The national weather service (nws) storm events database is utilized, and a total of 74,814 flash flood events are assessed during 1996-2017. The frequency, duration, property damages, and fatalities of flash floods are investigated across spatial domains (i.e. County, state, regional, and entire conus) and multiple temporal scales (i.e. Annual, seasonal, monthly, and diurnal). Results indicate that flash flood frequency has slightly increased over the conus in the past 22 years, and the property damages have substantially raised. Flash floods are found to be more frequent in summer and less frequent but longer in winter. Our analyses indicate distinct regional patterns for duration of median versus extreme flash floods. In addition, the diurnal distribution of flash floods indicate that they are more likely to initiate in the evening and terminate around midnight. The average duration of flash floods in the past 22 years has been about 3.5 h, yet in some rare cases, they persisted for about two days. The findings of this study can shed light on flash flood hazard across the conus, which can be useful for mitigating flash flood risks.",FLASH FLOOD; CONUS; HAZARD; DAMAGE; CASUALTY,ATMOSPHERIC RIVERS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; EXTREME PRECIPITATION; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; RISK COMMUNICATION; HURRICANE HARVEY; RAINFALL; IMPACT; PREDICTION; DURATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,none,"AHMADALIPOUR, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ALABAMA, CTR COMPLEX HYDROSYST RES, DEPT CIVIL CONSTRUCT \& ENVIRONM ENGN, TUSCALOOSA, AL 35487 USA.;AHMADALIPOUR, ALI, MORADKHANI, HAMID, UNIV ALABAMA, CTR COMPLEX HYDROSYST RES, DEPT CIVIL CONSTRUCT \& ENVIRONM ENGN, TUSCALOOSA, AL 35487 USA.",10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2019.124106,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,,0022-1694,,,ELSEVIER,578,2019,ISI000497250200095,124,"ENGINEERING, GEOLOGY, WATER RESOURCES",20,"ENGINEERING, CIVIL, GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, WATER RESOURCES",AAHMADAUA.EDU HMORADKHANIUA.EDU,,JO0AN,,"AHMADALIPOUR, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ALABAMA, CTR COMPLEX HYDROSYST RES, DEPT CIVIL CONSTRUCT \& ENVIRONM ENGN, TUSCALOOSA, AL 35487 USA",ISI,UNIV ALABAMA,UNIV ALABAMA,,"AHMADALIPOUR A, 2019, J HYDROL","AHMADALIPOUR A, 2019, J HYDROL",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,1_6,3_13,0,1
38,Forte F;Pennetta L;Strobl Ro,Historic records and gis applications for flood risk analysis in the salento peninsula (southern italy),NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"The occurrence of calamitous meteoric events represents a current problem of the salento peninsula (southern italy). In fact, flash floods, generated by very intense rainfall, occur not only in autumn and winter, but at the end of summer as well. These calamities are amplified by peculiar geological and geomorphological characteristics of salento and by the pollution of sinkholes. Floodings affect often large areas, especially in the impermeable lowering zones. These events cause warnings and emergency states, involving people as well as socio-economic goods. A methodical investigation based on the historic flood records and an analysis of the geoenvironmental factors have been performed, using a geographic information system (gis) methodology for database processing in order to identify the distribution of areas with different risk degrees. The data, referring to events that occurred from 1968 to 2004, have been collected in a database, the so-called iphas (salento alluvial phenomena inventory), extracted in an easily consultable table. The final goal is the development of a risk map where the areas that are affected by floodings are included between small ridges, the so-called ``serre. More than 50\% of the salento peninsula shows high or very high risk values. The numerous maps that were utilized and gencrated represent an important basis in order to quantify the flood risk, according to the model using historic records.",,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,28,"*AG ENV PROT TECHN, 2001, NAST GEOL SURV IT AP.","FORTE, F (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV BARI, SEZ GEOG FIS \& GEOMORFOL, DIPARTIMENTO GEOL \& GEOFIS, VIA E ORABONA 4, I-70125 BARI, ITALY.;UNIV BARI, SEZ GEOG FIS \& GEOMORFOL, DIPARTIMENTO GEOL \& GEOFIS, I-70125 BARI, ITALY.;ITC INT INST GEOINFORMAT SCI \& EARTH OBSERV, NL-7514 AE ENSCHEDE, NETHERLANDS.",10.5194/NHESS-5-833-2005,"MAX-PLANCK-STR 13, 37191 KATLENBURG-LINDAU, GERMANY",,,,1561-8633,6,833-844,EUROPEAN GEOSCIENCES UNION,5,2005,ISI000234749700007,49,"GEOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",11,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",GEOFORTELIBERO.IT,,004JS,,"FORTE, F (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV BARI, SEZ GEOG FIS \& GEOMORFOL, DIPARTIMENTO GEOL \& GEOFIS, VIA E ORABONA 4, I-70125 BARI, ITALY",ISI,UNIV BARI;ITC INT INST GEOINFORMAT SCI AND EARTH OBSERV,UNIV BARI,,"FORTE F, 2005, NAT HAZARDS EARTH SYST SCI","FORTE F, 2005, NAT HAZARDS EARTH SYST SCI",FALSE,0,0,1,0,0,0,3_13_14,0,2

However, there is a lack of comprehensive, high-resolution data on historical changes in land use, population, or assets available to study this topic. Here, we present the historical analysis of natural hazards in europe (hanze) database, which contains two parts: (1) hanze-exposure with maps for 37 countries and territories from 1870 to 2020 in 100m resolution and (2) hanze-events, a compilation of past disasters with information on dates, locations, and losses, currently limited to floods only. The database was constructed using high-resolution maps of present land use and population, a large compilation of historical statistics, and relatively simple disaggregation techniques and rule-based land use reallocation schemes. Data encompassed in hanze allow one to ``normalize information on losses due to natural hazards by taking into account inflation as well as changes in population, production, and wealth. This database of past events currently contains 1564 records (1870-2016) of flash, river, coastal, and compound floods.

97,Zaginaev V;Ballesteros-Canvas Ja;Erokhin S;Matov E;Petrakov D;Stoffel M,Reconstruction of glacial lake outburst floods in northern tien shan: implications for hazard assessment,GEOMORPHOLOGY,"Glacier lake outburst floods (glofs) and related debris flows are among the most significant natural threats in the tien shan mountains of kyrgyzstan and have even caused the loss of life and damage to infrastructure in its capital bishkek. An improved understanding of the occurrence of this process is essential so as to be able to design reliable disaster risk reduction strategies, even more so in view of ongoing climate change and scenarios of future evolutions. Here, we apply a dendrogeomorphic approach to reconstruct past debris-flow activity on the aksay cone (ala-archa valley, kyrgyz range), where outbursting glacier lakes and intense rainfalls have triggered huge debris flows over the past decades. A total of 96 picea abies (l.) Karst. Trees growing on the cone and along the main channel have been selected based on the evidence of past debris-flow damage in their trunks, these trees were then sampled using increment borers. The dating of past events was based on the assessment of growth disturbances (gd) in the tree-ring records and included the detection of injuries, tangential rows of traumatic resin ducts, reaction wood, and abrupt growth changes. In total, 320 gd were identified in the tree-ring samples. In combination with aerial imagery and geomorphic recognition in the field, reactions in trees and their position on the cone have allowed reconstruction of the main spatial patterns of past events on the aksay cone. Our findings suggest that at least 27 debris flows have occurred on the site between 1877 and 2015 and point to the occurrence of at least 17 events that were not documented prior to this study. We also observe high process activity during the 1950s and 1960s, with major events on the cone in 1950, 1966, and 1968, coinciding with phases of slight glacier advance. The spatial analyses of events also point to two different spatial patterns, suggesting that quite dissimilar magnitudes probably occurred during glacier lake outburst floods and rainfall induced debris-flow events. The results presented here represent the longest, annually resolved glof series in the region, which in turn has key implications on risk assessment, not just in the ala-archa valley, but also in the entire kyrgyz range (northern tien shan).

184,Hamdy O;Zhao S;Salheen Ma;Eid Yy,Identifying the risk areas and urban growth by arcgis-tools,GEOSCIENCES,"Abouelreesh is one of the most at risk areas in aswan, egypt, which suffers from storms, poor drainage, and flash flooding. These phenomena affect the urban areas and cause a lot of damage to buildings and infrastructure. Moreover, the potential for the further realization of dangerous situations increased when the urban areas of abouelreesh extended towards the risk areas. In an effort to ameliorate the danger, two key issues for urban growth management were studied, namely: (i) estimations regarding the pace of urban sprawl, and (ii) the identification of urban areas located in regions that would be affected by flash floods. Analyzing these phenomena require a lot of data in order to obtain good results, but in our case, the official data or field data was limited so we tried to obtain it by accessing two kinds of free sources of satellite data. First, we used arc gis tools to analyze (digital elevation model (dem)) files in order to study the watershed and better identify the risk area. Second, we studied historical imagery in google earth to determine the age of each urban block. The urban growth rate in the risk areas had risen to 63.31\% in 2001. Urban growth in the case study area had been influenced by house sizes, because most people were looking to live in bigger houses. The aforementioned problem can be observed by considering the increasing average house sizes from 2001 until 2013, where, especially in risky areas, the average of house sizes had grown from 223 m(2) in 2001 to 318 m(2) in 2013. The findings from this study would be useful to urban planners and government officials in helping them to make informed decisions on urban development to benefit the community, especially those living in areas at risk from flash flooding from heavy rain events.",URBAN PLANNING; RISK AREA; DEM; URBAN SPRAWL; ASWAN; GIS,FLASH-FLOOD RISK; MANAGEMENT; MODEL,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"AJIBADE I, 2013, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V23, P1714, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2013.08.009.;AMIR M., 2014, P 19 AUSTR FLUID MEC, P8.;[ANONYMOUS], 2010, PRELIMINARY REPORT T.;BELAL AA, 2011, EGYPT J REMOTE SENS, V14, P73, DOI 10.1016/J.EJRS.2011.09.001.;CLARK ML, 2011, REMOTE SENS-BASEL, V3, P601, DOI 10.3390/RS3030601.;COLLIN A, 2014, ISPRS INT J GEO-INF, V3, P1157, DOI 10.3390/IJGI3041157.;DE RISI R, 2015, J HYDROL, V527, P316, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2015.04.070.;DO HT, 2011, PROCEDIA COMPUT SCI, V4, P2277, DOI 10.1016/J.PROCS.2011.04.248.;DODMAN D., 2012, ADAPTING CITIES CLIM.;EINFALT T, 2009, URBAN WATER J, V6, P369, DOI 10.1080/15730620902934819.;GENERAL ORGANIZATION OF PHYSICAL PLANNING, 2010, DET PLANN VILL A RIS.;JALAYER F, 2014, NAT HAZARDS, V73, P975, DOI 10.1007/S11069-014-1119-2.;JHA AK, 2012, CITIES AND FLOODING: A GUIDE TO INTEGRATED URBAN FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT FOR THE 21ST CENTURY, P1, DOI 10.1596/978-0-8213-8866-2.;KABURI A.

The global forest resources assessment 2015 reported that privately owned forest area are increasing on a global scale, but deforestation was found very active in privately owned hill forest areas of malaysia. Penang state was purposively chosen as it has been experiencing rapid and radical changes due to urban expansion over the last three decades. In this study, analyses of land-use changes were done by pci geomatica using landsat images from 1991 to 2015, future trends of land-use change were assessed using excel forecast function, and its impact on the surrounding environment were conducted by reviewing already published articles on changing environment of the study area. This study revealed an annual deforestation rate of 1.4\% in penang island since 1991. Trend analysis forecasted a forest area smaller than the current forest reserves by the year 2039. Impact analysis revealed a rapid biodiversity loss with increasing landslides, mudflows, water pollution, flash flood, and health hazard. An immediate ban over hill-land development is crucial for overall environmental safety. (C) 2017 elsevier ltd.

The flash flood claimed the lives of 35 human beings and 436 livestock, and affected about 12,000 people, damaging property worth about rs 612 crore. It has been observed that most of the damages in the area is related to the physiographic disposition of the quaternary deposits lying along the valley slopes. The continued and recurring flash floods in the himalaya call for a disaster management policy that needs to be undertaken in the himalayan terrain.

70,Santo A;Di Crescenzo G;Del Prete S;Di Iorio L,The ischia island flash flood of november 2009 (italy): phenomenon analysis and flood hazard,PHYSICS AND CHEMISTRY OF THE EARTH,"The island of ischia is particularly susceptible to landslides and flash floods due to its particular geological and geomorphological context. Urbanization in recent decades coupled with the development of tourism has increased the risk. After the november 10, 2009 event occurring in the northern sector of the island (the town of casamicciola), a detailed geo-morphological survey was conducted to ascertain the evolution of the phenomenon. In the watersheds upstream of casamicciola, many landslides were mapped and the volume of material involved during detachment and sliding was estimated. In the lower course area, near the town and towards the sea, flow pathways were reconstructed with the aid of extensive video footage taken during the event. Rainfall data were also analyzed and a relationship was established between the hourly rainfall rate and the flash flood. The phenomenon was found to be quite complex, with many upstream landslides stopping before reaching the urban area. In the lower course the alluvial event occurred as a flood with a very small sediment discharge, which left a very thin layer of sediment. Reconstruction of the flash flood phenomenon suggested possible action for future risk mitigation, early warning and civil protection plans. (C) 2012 elsevier ltd.

117,Santo A;Santangelo N;Di Crescenzo G;Scorpio V;De Falco M;Chirico Gb,Flash flood occurrence and magnitude assessment in an alluvial fan context: the october 2011 event in the southern apennines,NATURAL HAZARDS,"This study presents the analysis of flash floods triggered by an extreme rainfall event that occurred on 7 october, 2011, over the marzano carbonate massif (southern apennines). The rainfall event reactivated alluvial fans built up at the outlet of two mountain basins. Detailed geological surveys carried out immediately after the event allowed the reconstruction of the main erosion and depositional processes that occurred both in the drainage basin and in the fan areas. The volume of materials eroded in the basin and deposited in the fan was evaluated by means of accurate topographic surveying and gps measurements. Morphological and morphometric properties of the basin/fan system as well as the presence of human interventions and structures along the main channel and in the fan area influenced flow propagation. The transported materials came mainly from debris and gravels previously accumulated along the stream beds and mobilised by the flow during the event. No significant evidence of landslide contribution to transported bed load was detected. Extensive damage was done to buildings, river bank structures and agricultural crops. Despite the existence of hundreds of similar alluvial/fan systems in the southern apennines, few studies have been conducted to support adequate risk mitigation action in these areas. Indeed, to our knowledge, this is the first study focusing on assessing the magnitude of alluvial fan flooding in the context of the southern apennines. Studies like the present one may help determine the volumes involved during flash floods whilst providing support for detailed flood hazard zoning and for risk mitigation planning.",FLASH FLOOD; DEBRIS FLOW; ALLUVIAL FAN; EVENT MAGNITUDE; SOUTHERN APENNINES,EASTERN ITALIAN ALPS; DEBRIS-FLOW; MORPHOMETRIC CONTROLS; NEW-ZEALAND; PREDICTION; AREAS; SUSCEPTIBILITY; LANDSLIDES; MORPHOLOGY; MOBILITY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,9,"AMATO A, 1992, STUDI GEOLOGICI CAME, V1, P191.;ASCIONE A, 2003, QUATERN INT, V101, P27, DOI 10.1016/S1040-6182(02)00127-1.;ASCIONE A, 2013, GEOL SOC AM BULL, V125, P1239, DOI 10.1130/B30814.1.;AULITZKY H, 1980, BAD ISCHL, V4, P285.;BERTI M, 2007, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V90, P144, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2007.01.014.;BONARDI G., 1988, MEM SOC GEOL ITAL, V4, P17.;BULL W.

The case study of the 2014 flood in athens, greece",URBAN WATER JOURNAL,"Urban flooding is a gradually increasing problem as the urban population expands into floodplains. In urban environments, flood vulnerability is significantly increased as a more concentrated population and assets makes flooding costly and challenging, in terms of impact estimation. This work focuses on mapping and classifying impacts after the catastrophic 2014 flood in athens, greece. The study proposes a method for classifying flood effects into four categories including: the natural and built environment, mobile objects and human population, organized in five classes of increasing severity, i.e. Minor, weak, moderate, strong and extreme. Flood effects are grouped based on the qualitative nature of the recorded effects, allowing the development of an impact-severity map. Mapping of the 2014 flood effects indicated specific locations where the severity of impacts was distinctively higher than others, providing a holistic overview of the flood's effects and highlighting the usefulness of the approach in future flood protection planning.",FLOOD IMPACT; URBAN FLOOD; FLOOD EFFECTS; ATHENS GREECE,FLASH-FLOOD; GIS; UNCERTAINTY; EVOLUTION; DATABASE; EUROPE; EVENT; AREA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,4,"ALFIERI L., 2015, HYDROL EARTH SYST SC, V12, P1119, DOI DOI 10.5194/HESSD-12-1119-2015.;ANTROP M, 2004, LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN, V67, P9, DOI 10.1016/S0169-2046(03)00026-4.;BAKER VR, 1977, GEOL SOC AM BULL, V88, P1057, DOI 10.1130/0016-7606(1977)88<1057:SRTFWE>2.0.CO,2.;BARREDO JI, 2007, NAT HAZARDS, V42, P125, DOI 10.1007/S11069-006-9065-2.;BARRERA A, 2006, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V6, P505, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-6-505-2006.;CALIANNO M, 2013, J HYDROL, V477, P1, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2012.09.036.;DIAKAKIS M, 2014, J FLOOD RISK MANAG, V7, P332, DOI 10.1111/JFR3.12053.;DIAKAKIS M., 2014, J FLOOD RISK MANAG, V10, P30.;DIAKAKIS M., 2015, J FLOOD RISK MANAG, DOI [10.1111/JFR3.12166, DOI 10.1111/JFR3.12166].;DIAKAKIS M., 2016, EUR J TRANSP INF RES, V16, P114.;DIAKAKIS M, 2016, INT J DISAST RISK RE, V18, P171, DOI 10.1016/J.IJDRR.2016.06.010.;DIAKAKIS M, 2016, ENVIRON HAZARDS-UK, V15, P148, DOI 10.1080/17477891.2016.1147412.;DIAKAKIS M, 2014, ISPRS INT GEO-INF, V3, P96, DOI 10.3390/IJGI3010096.;DIAKAKIS M, 2013, ENVIRON HAZARDS-UK, V12, P278, DOI 10.1080/17477891.2013.832651.;DIAKAKIS M, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V62, P485, DOI 10.1007/S11069-012-0090-Z.;DJORDJEVI S., 2013, APPL UNCERTAINTY ANA, P297.;FEDESKI M, 2007, LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN, V83, P50, DOI 10.1016/J.LANDURBPLAN.2007.05.012.;FRENI G, 2010, WATER SCI TECHNOL, V61, P2979, DOI 10.2166/WST.2010.177.;GOURLEY JJ, 2013, B AM METEOROL SOC, V94, P799, DOI 10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00198.1.;GUPTA A, 1983, MODERN ANCIENT FLUVI, V6, P219, DOI DOI 10.1002/9781444303773.;HANDMER J., 2001, GLOB ENV CHANGE B, V3, P19, DOI DOI 10.1016/S1464-2867(01)00010-9.;JHA AK, 2012, CITIES AND FLOODING: A GUIDE TO INTEGRATED URBAN FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT FOR THE 21ST CENTURY, P1, DOI 10.1596/978-0-8213-8866-2.;JONKMAN SN, 2005, DISASTERS, V29, P75, DOI 10.1111/J.0361-3666.2005.00275.X.;JUNG IW, 2011, HYDROL EARTH SYST SC, V15, P617, DOI 10.5194/HESS-15-617-2011.;KANDILIOTI G, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V61, P441, DOI 10.1007/S11069-011-9930-5.;KOUTSOYIANNIS D, 2000, NAT HAZARDS, V22, P29, DOI 10.1023/A:1008001312219.;KOUTSOYIANNIS D., 2012, CHANGES FLOOD RISK E, P238.;LEON V.

The power plant utilises local coal to generate thermal power and disposes of large amount of ash which accumulates in slurry form at nearby two ash ponds. These ash ponds were breached on 31 december 2000, causing ash accumulation for entire regime of the nandira river. An attempt has been made towards preparation of recovery and rehabilitation plan for nalco using temporal remote sensing data and gis. Indian remote sensing satellite data for pre-breach condition 12 december 2000, during breach event 31 december 2000 and post-breach condition 4 and 6 january 2001 has been digitally analysed for nandira watershed. The satellite data of coarse spatial resolution provides the absence and presence of fresh sediment deposition along nandira watershed and brahmani river pertaining to pre-breach and post-breach conditions respectively on regional scales. The temporal comparison of fine resolution has clearly highlighted the aerial extent of damage caused by the disaster for entire watershed on local scales. The gis has helped in demarcation of freshly accumulated ash at interval of 500 m along the river length as well as in delineation of maximum ash accumulation across the liver width.

Flash floods pose significant threats to socio-economic development in the region. This study assessed flash floods risk in the greater nuweiba area in support of mitigation planning. Our approach evaluated topographic, hydrological, and geological factors holistically to rank areas of high, median, and low flash floods risk along the wadi watir. Data from field surveys, enhanced thematic mapper (etm+) imagery, and shuttle radar terrain model (srtm) were analyzed through digital image processing and spatial analysis to characterize lithology, soil types, land cover, and hydrological morphometrics. The morphometric parameters were used to evaluate the most sensitive sub-basins for flooding and create the flash flood susceptibility map. Soil conservation service (scs) rainfall-runoff model was used to estimate hydrological responses at ungauged catchments, including runoff depth, lag time, and peak discharge. We spatially integrated all the risk factors and created a flash floods risk map as the practical geospatial assessment of flash flood risk in the greater nuweiba area. (C) 2016 elsevier ltd.

327,Ahmed Mr;Rahaman Kr;Kok A;Hassan Qk,Remote sensing-based quantification of the impact of flash flooding on the rice production: a case study over northeastern bangladesh,SENSORS,"The northeastern region of bangladesh often experiences flash flooding during the pre-harvesting period of the boro rice crop, which is the major cereal crop in the country. In this study, our objective was to delineate the impact of the 2017 flash flood (that initiated on 27 march 2017) on boro rice using multi-temporal landsat-8 oli and modis data. Initially, we opted to use landsat-8 oli data for mapping the damages, however, during and after the flooding event the acquisition of cloud free images were challenging. Thus, we used this data to map the cultivated boro rice acreage considering the planting to mature stages of the crop. Also, in order to map the extent of the damaged boro area, we utilized modis data as their 16-day composites provided cloud free information. Our results indicated that both the cultivated and damaged boro area estimates based on satellite data had strong relationships while compared to the ground-based estimates (i.e., r(2) values approximately 0.92 for both cases, and rmse of 18,374 and 9380 ha for cultivated and damaged areas, respectively). Finally, we believe that our study would be critical for planning and ensuring food security for the country.",LANDSAT-8; MODIS; NORMALIZED DIFFERENCE VEGETATION INDEX (NDVI); MULTI-TEMPORAL DATA; BORO RICE,DAMAGE; SOUTH; CROP,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,5,"AHMED I, 2008, ECOL ECON, V68, P429, DOI 10.1016/J.ECOLECON.2008.04.016.;BANGLADESH BUREAU OF STATISTICS, YB AGR STAT 2015.;BISWAS J.

377,Abushandi E,"Flood prevention dams for arid regions at a micro-scale sub-catchment, case study: tabuk, saudi arabia",WATER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY,"Unexpected flash flooding is one of the periodic hydrological problems affecting the city of tabuk in saudi arabia. The region has high potential for floods as it suffers high rainfall intensity in a short time and also has high urbanization rates and topographic complexity. Constructing flood prevention dams is one option to solve this problem. A cost-effective design requires a detailed feasibility study and analysis for the selection of suitable sites. The aim of this study was to develop a method for selecting a suitable site for flood protection dams in the abu saba'a district, the most affected part of the city of tabuk during the flash flood in january 2013. Spatial analysis was applied using landsat thematic mapper images and shuttle radar topography mission digital elevation model to select a site in the abu saba'a area. A simple model using arcgis was built including all suggested parameters. The results showed the best site for a dam was 2 km distance backfrom the area, where all parameter values matched. The results showed that the dynamic properties of land cover can affect site selection. It is therefore suggested that more field and hydrological data should be gathered for greater accuracy.",ARID REGIONS; DAMS; FLASH FLOOD; GIS; REMOTE SENSING; TABUK,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"ABUSHANDI E, 2015, HYDROL CURR RES, V6, P189, DOI [10.4172/2157-7587.1000189, DOI 10.4172/2157-7587.1000189].;ABUSHANDI EH, 2011, J WATER CLIM CHANGE, V2, P56, DOI 10.2166/WCC.2011.048.;AL HAMID A.

A model has been developed for flood damage estimation based on a geographic information system (gis). It could be used by land administration bodies and insurance companies to manage flood-related damage data. The model simulates flood scenarios and evaluates expected economic losses from the impact of floodwaters on exposed elements, through the application of a computational model elaborated by gis. During the development of the model, the boesio stream, a small watercourse flowing into lake maggiore (lombardy, northern italy) which was recently affected by a flash flood, was used as case study to test and calibrate the methodology. The method could be used either as a forecasting tool to define event scenarios, utilizing data from events simulated with a hydraulic model, or for real-time damage assessment after a disaster. The approach is suitable to large-area damage assessment and could be appropriate for land use planning, civil protection and risk mitigation.",FLOOD; DAMAGE EVALUATION; STAGE-DAMAGE CURVES; HYDRAULIC MODELLING; GIS,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,43,"*AG TERR OSS MERC, 2007, BANC DAT QUOT IMM AG.","LUINO, F (REPRINT AUTHOR), ITALIAN NATL RES COUNCIL, RES INST GEOHYDROL PROTECT, IRPI CNR, STR CACCE 73, I-10135 TURIN, ITALY.;LUINO, F., GODONE, F., ITALIAN NATL RES COUNCIL, RES INST GEOHYDROL PROTECT, IRPI CNR, I-10135 TURIN, ITALY.",10.1007/S10707-008-0070-3,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,,1384-6175,3,339-353,SPRINGER,13,2009,ISI000266162800008,14,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY",26,"COMPUTER SCIENCE, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, GEOGRAPHY, PHYSICAL",FABIO.LUINOIRPI.CNR.IT,,447AA,,"LUINO, F (REPRINT AUTHOR), ITALIAN NATL RES COUNCIL, RES INST GEOHYDROL PROTECT, IRPI CNR, STR CACCE 73, I-10135 TURIN, ITALY",ISI,RES INST GEOHYDROL PROTECT,RES INST GEOHYDROL PROTECT,,"LUINO F, 2009, GEOINFORMATICA","LUINO F, 2009, GEOINFORMATICA",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0,2,3_4,0,1
43,Mebarki A;Valencia N;Salagnac Jl;Barroca B,"Flood hazards and masonry constructions: a probabilistic framework for damage, risk and resilience at urban scale",NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"This paper deals with the failure risk of masonry constructions under the effect of floods. It is developed within a probabilistic framework, with loads and resistances considered as random variables. Two complementary approaches have been investigated for this purpose: - a global approach based on combined effects of several governing parameters with individual weighted contribution (material quality and geometry, presence and distance between columns, beams, openings, resistance of the soil and its slope...), - and a reliability method using the failure mechanism of masonry walls standing out-plane pressure. The evolution of the probability of failure of masonry constructions according to the flood water level is analysed. The analysis of different failure probability scenarios for masonry walls is conducted to calibrate the influence of each ``vulnerability governing parameter in the global approach that is widely used in risk assessment at the urban or regional scale. The global methodology is implemented in a gis that provides the spatial distribution of damage risk for different flood scenarios. A real case is considered for the simulations, i.e. Cheffes sur sarthe (france), for which the observed river discharge, the hydraulic load according to the digital terrain model, and the structural resistance are considered as random variables. The damage probability values provided by both approaches are compared.

This study has computed, mapped, and analyzed the physical vulnerability, social vulnerability, and overall composite flash flood vulnerability (cfvi) indices using a simulated flood and 2006 census data on seven social variables for 153 neighborhoods of the city of riyadh, the capital of the kingdom of saudi arabia. The physical vulnerability index was computed by ranking a potential flood depth map created by simulating a 6 h of high-intense rainfall in the city. The social vulnerability index was constructed by standardizing the social data variables. Finally, the two indices were multiplied to create the cfvi. The cfvi map revealed that the low-lying central and southern half of the city is highly vulnerable, northern and northeastern peripheral neighborhoods are moderately to highly vulnerable, and the mountainous western neighborhoods are the least vulnerable to flash flooding. Low-income and unemployed expatriate families living in densely populated central, south, and southeastern neighborhoods are more vulnerable to flooding than rich saudi families living in the sparsely populated northern half of the central city, western, northwestern, and southwestern neighborhoods. The cfvi map will help city planners to formulate effective flood control measures to protect the city residents and urban infrastructures from future flood damage. This flood vulnerability research can be expanded to other saudi cities by incorporating more physical and social variables.",VULNERABILITY; FLASH FLOODS; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; RIYADH; SAUDI ARABIA,CLIMATE-CHANGE; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS; UNITED-STATES; PARAMETERS; DISASTERS; IMPACTS; PEOPLE; INDEX,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,11,"ADGER W.

Flash floods are characterized by a high degree of risk, primarily due to reduced possibilities to make effective forecasts, but also because of weather and climatic characteristics that changed in the last decades, thus limiting the possibilities of application of appropriate defense and adaptation measures. In this context, the paper aims to make a preliminary assessment of vulnerability to flash floods, using hydrological simulation models based on gis techniques applied in sub-basins, allowing a ranking of risks within relevant locations, especially concerning the cultural heritage in the county of iasi.

503,Li W;Lin K;Zhao T;Lan T;Chen X;Du H;Chen H,Risk assessment and sensitivity analysis of flash floods in ungauged basins using coupled hydrologic and hydrodynamic models,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Flash floods are among the most devastating natural hazards but the analyses of flash floods are hindered by the lack of hydro-meteorological data. In particular, data issues are critical in ungauged basins. This paper presents an investigation of flash flood modeling using coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models. Specifically, the topography-based hydrological model (topmodel) is employed to obtain the flood hydrograph and the coupled 1d-2d hydrodynamic model mikeflood is used to simulate floodplain inundation. The methods are tested in the pajiang river, a mountainous basin in south china. The results show that the topmodel effectively simulates the flood hydrograph and the nash-sutcliffe coefficients of the flow rate are larger than 0.80 for both calibration and validation. Also, mikeflood effectively simulates the flood inundation extent and flooding depth and the bias for simulated water level is - 0.004 m. Further, using socioeconomic and historical flood disaster datasets, areas with high flash flood risk are identified. A flash flood risk assessment shows a clear trend of change in the flood hazard and the spatial heterogeneity of the flood vulnerability is significant. A sensitivity analysis of the flood vulnerability to the socioeconomic indicators indicates that cultivated land is the most sensitive indicators, and the population and the construction areas have similar influences. Overall, the coupled hydrological and hydrodynamic models prove effective and can be used in practical applications for flash flood risk mapping.",TOPMODEL; MIKEFLOOD; UNGAUGED BASINS; RUNOFF SIMULATION; FLASH FLOOD ASSESSMENT,MULTICRITERIA DECISION-MAKING; ANALYTIC HIERARCHY PROCESS; WEIGHTS-OF-EVIDENCE; FREQUENCY RATIO; RIVER-BASIN; CATCHMENTS; GIS; REGIONALIZATION; RAINFALL; UNCERTAINTY,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,6,none,"LIN, KR (REPRINT AUTHOR), SUN YAT SEN UNIV, CTR WATER RESOURCES \& ENVIRONM, GUANGZHOU 510275, GUANGDONG, PEOPLES R CHINA.;LI, WENJING, LIN, KAIRONG, ZHAO, TONGTIEGANG, LAN, TIAN, CHEN, XIAOHONG, CHEN, HAIYAN, SUN YAT SEN UNIV, CTR WATER RESOURCES \& ENVIRONM, SCH CIVIL ENGN, GUANGZHOU 510275, GUANGDONG, PEOPLES R CHINA.;LI, WENJING, DU, HONGWEI, MINIST ENVIRONM PROTECT PEOPLES REPUBL CHINA, NATL KEY LAB WATER ENVIRONM SIMULAT \& POLLUT CONT, GUANGZHOU 510535, GUANGDONG, PEOPLES R CHINA.;LI, WENJING, DU, HONGWEI, MINIST ENVIRONM PROTECT PEOPLES REPUBL CHINA, GUANGDONG KEY LAB WATER \& AIR POLLUT CONTROL, SOUTH CHINA INST ENVIRONM SCI, GUANGZHOU 510535, GUANGDONG, PEOPLES R CHINA.;LIN, KAIRONG, ZHAO, TONGTIEGANG, CHEN, XIAOHONG, GUANGDONG ENGN TECHNOL RES CTR WATER SECUR REGULA, GUANGZHOU 510275, GUANGDONG, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2019.03.002,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,"NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [51779279, 51822908]; NATIONAL KEY R\&D PROGRAM OF CHINA [2017YFC0405900]; OPEN RESEARCH FOUNDATION OF DYNAMICS AND THE ASSOCIATED PROCESS CONTROL KEY LABORATORY IN THE PEARL RIVER ESTUARY OF MINISTRY OF WATER RESOURCES [2017KJ12]; BAIQIANWAN PROJECT'S YOUNG TALENTS PLAN OF SPECIAL SUPPORT PROGRAM IN GUANGDONG PROVINCE [42150001]; FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR THE CENTRAL UNIVERSITIESFUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH FUNDS FOR THE CENTRAL UNIVERSITIES [20187614031620001]",,0022-1694,,108-120,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,572,2019,ISI000467891900009,71,"ENGINEERING, GEOLOGY, WATER RESOURCES",40,"ENGINEERING, CIVIL, GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, WATER RESOURCES",LINKRMAIL.SYSU.EDU.CN,,HY1QL,,"LIN, KR (REPRINT AUTHOR), SUN YAT SEN UNIV, CTR WATER RESOURCES \& ENVIRONM, GUANGZHOU 510275, GUANGDONG, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,SUN YAT SEN UNIV;NATL KEY LAB WATER ENVIRONM SIMULAT AND POLLUT CONT;SOUTH CHINA INST ENVIRONM SCI;GUANGDONG ENGN TECHNOL RES CTR WATER SECUR REGULA,SUN YAT SEN UNIV,,"LI W, 2019, J HYDROL","LI W, 2019, J HYDROL-a",FALSE,0,0,1,0,0,0,3_4,0,1

The signal sent by the sirens was intended to interrupt all the social activities, and the sound was likely to induce ``adapted behavior by the concerned authorities but also by the inhabitants. However, the nan remains often not used to alert population, as recalled after the flash floods observed in the aude basin river the 2018, october 15th.

In the czech republic, the ministry of the interior has supported an analysis dealing with the risks to residents, infrastructure, and water bodies from flash floods and sediment transport. A total of more than 150,000 risk points were identified by gis morphology and land-use analysis. The threat, the vulnerability, and the resulting risk category were determined for each of these points. The watem/sedem model was used to assess the threat with 10-m data resolution. The summarized vulnerability of real objects on individual runoff trajectories was combined with the threat of sediment transport, resulting in the overall risk represented by a 5-degree scale, from lowest (1) to highest (5). The output of the project lies stored in the web application. Nineteen percent of the sites in the czech republic, i.e., more than 23,000 sites, have been assigned to categories 4 and 5, with a high level of risk. Thirty-four percent of cadastral units are classified as the high risky (4416 cadasters, with a total area 24,707km(2)). Approximately 30\% of the population of the czech republic lives in high-risk cadastral areas. Four scenarios of protection were modeled. To reduce the high-risk and very high-risk sites (categories 4 and 5), the most effective solution is the implementation of technical measures or conversion to grassland within the contributing watersheds. This could reduce the number of high-risk sites from 23,400 to 3700.Methods of sediment transport modeling and risk evaluation, based on presented usle input data and documented watem/sedem model, can be used worldwide.

Rapid urbanization and exacerbated flooding have stimulated investigations of green land's role in mitigating urban flooding in china. The newly applied ``sponge city plan considers the concave green land (cgl) as an effective tool in mitigating pluvial floods. However, its capacity and beneficiaries still need to be elucidated. This paper fills this research gap by integrating urban flood simulation, scenario analysis, and mitigation assessment in central shanghai, china. It reveals that cgl could not only mitigate direct runoff and inundation, but also reduce population exposure and enhance community resilience. Cgl with a depth of 0.10-0.20 m can mitigate direct runoffs by 23.63-98.35\% and inundation extents by 26.09-82.41\%, resulting in a slide of the exposed urban population by 0.40-1.04 million persons and the exposed elders by 0.04-0.12 million persons. Moreover, the effectiveness of cgl varies spatially implying for a sound spatial planning of cgls and a potential combination with other flood mitigation measures. These findings could help cities particularly in developing countries to adapt to rising pluvial flooding through urban planning and nature-based flood mitigation measures.",URBAN FLOOD; URBANIZATION; MITIGATION; NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS; SHANGHAI,LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; FLASH-FLOOD; SHANGHAI; RISK; CHINA; CITY; PERFORMANCE; REDUCTION; SYSTEMS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,7,none,"WANG, CX (REPRINT AUTHOR), EAST CHINA NORMAL UNIV, MINIST EDUC, KEY LAB GEOG INFORMAT SCI, 500 DONGCHUAN RD, SHANGHAI 200241, PEOPLES R CHINA.;DU, SHIQIANG, WANG, CONGXIAO, SHEN, JU, WEN, JIAHONG, GAO, JUN, LIN, WENPENG, XU, HUI, SHANGHAI NORMAL UNIV, SCH ENVIRONM \& GEOG SCI, 100 GUILIN RD, SHANGHAI 200234, PEOPLES R CHINA.;WANG, CONGXIAO, WU, JIANPING, EAST CHINA NORMAL UNIV, MINIST EDUC, KEY LAB GEOG INFORMAT SCI, 500 DONGCHUAN RD, SHANGHAI 200241, PEOPLES R CHINA.;WANG, CONGXIAO, WU, JIANPING, EAST CHINA NORMAL UNIV, SCH GEOG SCI, 500 DONGCHUAN RD, SHANGHAI 200241, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.1016/J.SCS.2018.11.003,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,"NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [51761135024, 41871200, 41730642, 71603168]; NATIONAL KEY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM OF CHINA [2017YFC1503000]",,2210-6707,,774-782,ELSEVIER,44,2019,ISI000451754200062,56,"CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY, SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS, ENERGY \& FUELS",33,"CONSTRUCTION \& BUILDING TECHNOLOGY, GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY, ENERGY \& FUELS",CXWANG1992126.COM,,HC4DZ,,"WANG, CX (REPRINT AUTHOR), EAST CHINA NORMAL UNIV, MINIST EDUC, KEY LAB GEOG INFORMAT SCI, 500 DONGCHUAN RD, SHANGHAI 200241, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,SHANGHAI NORMAL UNIV;EAST CHINA NORMAL UNIV;EAST CHINA NORMAL UNIV,EAST CHINA NORMAL UNIV,,"DU S, 2019, SUST CITIES SOC","DU S, 2019, SUST CITIES SOC",FALSE,1,6,0,0,0,0,3_4,1,2

The proposed algorithm simulates the flood inundation of overland flows and in metro stations for each designed scenario. It involves the following stages: (i) determination of the grid location and spreading coefficient and (ii) an iterative calculation of the spreading process. In addition, an equation is proposed to calculate the inundation around a metro station and to predict the potential inundation risks of the metro system. The proposed method is applied to simulate the inundation risk of the metro system in the urban centre of shanghai under 50-year, 100-year, and 500-year rainfall intensities. Both inundation extent and depth are obtained and the proposed method is validated with records of historical floods. The results demonstrate that in the case of a 500-year rainfall intensity, the inundated area with a water depth excess of 300 mm covers up to 5.16 km(2).

115,Debionne S;Ruin I;Shabou S;Lutoff C;Creutin Jd,"Assessment of commuters' daily exposure to flash flooding over the roads of the gard region, france",JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"Flash floods are responsible for a majority of natural disaster fatalities in the usa and europe and most of them are vehicle-related. If human exposure to flood is generally assessed through the number of inhabitants per buildings located in flood prone zone, it is clear that this number varies dramatically throughout the day as people move from place to place to follow their daily program of activities. Knowing the number of motorists exposed on flood prone road sections or the factors determining their exposure would allow providing a more realistic evaluation of the degree of exposure. In order to bridge this gap and provide emergency managers with methods to assess the risk level for motorists, this paper describes two methods, a simple rough-and-ready estimate and a traffic attribution method, and applies both of them on datasets of the gard departement, an administrative region of southern france with about 700000 inhabitants over 5875 km(2). The first method to obtain an overall estimation of motorists flood exposure is to combine (i) the regional density of roads and rivers to derive a count of potential road cuts and (ii) the average daily kilometers driven by commuters of the study area to derive the number of people passing these potential cuts. If useful as a first approximation, this method fails to capture the spatial heterogeneities introduced by the geometry of river and road networks and the distribution of commuters' itineraries. To address this point, this paper (i) uses a pre-established detailed identification of road cuts (naulin et al., 2013) and (ii) applies a well-known traffic attribution method to existing and freely available census datasets. Both methods indicate that commuters' exposure is much larger than the number of commuters itself, illustrating the risk amplification effect of mobility. Comparing the results from both methods shows that (i) the road network geometry plays a significant role in reducing the risk of river-road dangerous intersections and (ii) not all commuters are equally exposed. Evidently commuters who have longer routes are more exposed, but residents of rural municipalities as well as professionals with highly qualified jobs are also more exposed. Finally, these exposure assessment methods applied to the gard area allows locating road sections where commuters' exposure to flood is high. It also sets the first step toward the implementation of a modeling platform able to combine the estimation of daily travel patterns exposure and behavioral response of motorists to road flooding, a critical input for emergency services and services in charge of the management of road networks in flash flood prone areas.

In the past years, the gard region (france) road management services have realized an extensive inventory of the known road submersions that occurred during the last 40 years. This inventory provided an unique opportunity to analyse the causes of road flooding in an area frequently affected by severe flash floods. It will be used to develop a road submersion susceptibility rating method, representing the first element of a road warning system. This paper presents the results of the analysis of this data set. A companion paper will show how the proposed road susceptibility rating method can be combined with distributed rainfall-runoff simulations to provide accurate road submersion risk maps. The very low correlation between the various possible explanatory factors and the susceptibility to flooding measured by the number of past observed submersions implied the use of particular statistical analysis methods based on the general principals of the discriminant analysis. The analysis led to the definition of four susceptibility classes for river crossing road sections. Validation tests confirmed that this classification is robust, at least in the considered area. One major outcome of the analysis is that the susceptibility to flooding is rather linked to the location of the road sections than to the size of the river crossing structure (bridge or culvert).",,RISK-ASSESSMENT; SEPTEMBER 2002; VULNERABILITY; HAZARD,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,28,"ANTOINE J-M., 2001, ANN GEOGR, V110, P597.;BEVEN K., 1979, HYDROL SCI B, V24, P43, DOI [DOI 10.1080/02626667909491834, 10.1080/02626667909491834].;*CEMAGREF, 1980, SYNTH NAT CRUES PET.","VERSINI, PA (REPRINT AUTHOR), CTR RECERCA APLICADA HIDROMETEOROL, BARCELONA, SPAIN.;VERSINI, P. -A., CTR RECERCA APLICADA HIDROMETEOROL, BARCELONA, SPAIN.;GAUME, E., ANDRIEU, H., LAB CENT PONTS \& CHAUSSEES, BOUGUENAIS, FRANCE.",10.5194/NHESS-10-793-2010,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",,EUROPEAN COMMUNITYEUROPEAN COMMUNITY (EC) [GOCE-CT-2004-505420],,1561-8633,4,793-803,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,10,2010,ISI000277185000016,34,"GEOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",23,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",PIERRE-ANTOINE.VERSINICRAHI.UPC.EDU,,589WN,,"VERSINI, PA (REPRINT AUTHOR), CTR RECERCA APLICADA HIDROMETEOROL, BARCELONA, SPAIN",ISI,CTR RECERCA APLICADA HIDROMETEOROL;LAB CENT PONTS AND CHAUSSEES,CTR RECERCA APLICADA HIDROMETEOROL,,"VERSINI PA, 2010, NAT HAZARDS EARTH SYST SCI","VERSINI PA, 2010, NAT HAZARDS EARTH SYST SCI",FALSE,1,6_7,2,0,0,6,3_4,0,2

In this work, a techno-economic methodology for the monetary estimation of crop losses due to flash flooding is presented. The methodology takes into account flood depth and flow velocity, as provided by mike flood, as well as the season of flood occurrence, and provides monetary estimates of crop damage based on synthetic logistic flow velocity-flood depth-crop damage surfaces. The development of the flood damage surfaces involved a questionnaire survey targeting practicing and research agronomists. Subsequently, a weighted monte carlo simulation was performed in order to enhance the questionnaire-based loss estimate information. Finally, synthetic flow velocity-flood depth-crop damage surfaces were developed for every crop under study and for every month using logistic regression analysis. The damage surfaces are an essential component of the developed model which was implemented in python, enabling the gis visualization of the estimated agricultural damage. The aforementioned methodology was applied for estimating the damage caused by a flash flood that took place in the koiliaris river basin in crete for which no historical data exist. The novelty of the proposed methodology is the development of local synthetic flow velocity-flood depth-crop damage surfaces. Furthermore, the velocity parameter, which is taken into account, makes the methodology suitable for flash flood events, where significant discharges and high velocities dominate, or for flood event cases which are characterized by high flow velocities.

Flooding scenarios, hazard mapping and damage estimation",NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"During the autumn of 2011 two catastrophic, very intense rainfall events affected two different parts of the liguria region of italy causing various flash floods. The first occurred in october and the second at the beginning of november. Both the events were characterized by very high rainfall intensities (> 100 mm h(-1)) that persisted on a small portion of territory causing local huge rainfall accumulations (> 400 mm 6 h(-1)). Two main considerations were made in order to set up this work. The first consideration is that various studies demonstrated that the two events had a similar genesis and similar triggering elements. The second very evident and coarse concern is that two main elements are needed to have a flash flood: a very intense and localized rainfall event and a catchment (or a group of catchments) to be affected. Starting from these assumptions we did the exercise of mixing the two flash flood ingredients by putting the rainfall field of the first event on the main catchment struck by the second event, which has its mouth in the biggest city of the liguria region: genoa. A complete framework was set up to quantitatively carry out a ``what if experiment with the aim of evaluating the possible damages associated with this event. A probabilistic rainfall downscaling model was used to generate possible rainfall scenarios maintaining the main characteristics of the observed rainfall fields while a hydrological model transformed these rainfall scenarios in streamflow scenarios. A subset of streamflow scenarios is then used as input to a 2-d hydraulic model to estimate the hazard maps, and finally a proper methodology is applied for damage estimation. This leads to the estimation of the potential economic losses and of the risk level for the people that stay in the affected area. The results are interesting, surprising and in a way worrying: a rare but not impossible event (it occurred about 50 km away from genoa) would have caused huge damages estimated between 120 and eur 230 million for the affected part of the city of genoa, italy, and more than 17 000 potentially affected people.",,FLASH-FLOOD; EXTREME RAINFALL; RADAR; PRECIPITATION; UNCERTAINTY; FORECAST; PROPOSAL; BASINS; MODEL; AREA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,4,"ABT SR, 1989, WATER RESOUR BULL, V25, P881.;ALFIERI L, 2012, J HYDROL, V424, P143, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2011.12.038.;AMENGUAL A, 2007, J HYDROMETEOROL, V8, P282, DOI 10.1175/JHM577.1.;[ANONYMOUS], 2014, PROVV REG O O P P LO.;BARTHLOTT C, 2013, Q J ROY METEOR SOC, V139, P1762, DOI 10.1002/QJ.2089.;BERENGUER M, 2005, J HYDROMETEOROL, V6, P532, DOI 10.1175/JHM433.1.;BHADURI B., 2007, ENCY GIS, P880.;BONI G, 2007, ADV WATER RESOUR, V30, P2135, DOI 10.1016/J.ADVWATRES.2006.08.009.;BORGA M, 2011, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V14, P834, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2011.05.017.;BRANDOLINI P, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P943, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-943-2012.;BUZZI A, 2014, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V14, P1325, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-14-1325-2014.;DAVOLIO S, 2015, J HYDROMETEOROL, V16, P1843, DOI 10.1175/JHM-D-14-0094.1.;DEICHMANN U., 2011, USING HIGH RESOLUTIO, P32.;DEKAY ML, 1993, RISK ANAL, V13, P193, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.1993.TB01069.X.;DELRIEU G, 2005, J HYDROMETEOROL, V6, P34, DOI 10.1175/JHM-400.1.;FEMA DEPT.

We have interpreted high spatial resolution images, conducted field surveys, and utilized numerical simulations, in order to assess vulnerability across arequipa, south peru, close to the active el misti volcano. The emphasis of this study was on flash floods and volcanic or non-volcanic hyperconcentrated flows, which recur on average every 3.5 years across the city. We utilized a geographic information system to embed vulnerability and hazard maps as a step to calculate risk for buildings and bridges along the rio chili valley and two tributaries. A survey of similar to 1,000 buildings from 46 city blocks, different in age, construction materials, and land usage, provided architectural and structural characteristics. A similar survey of twenty bridges across the three valleys was based on structural, hydraulic, and strategic parameters. Interpretation of high spatial resolution (hsr) satellite images, which allows for quick identification of approximately 69 \% of the structural building types, effectively supplemented field data collection. Mapping vulnerability has led us to pinpoint strategic areas in case of future destructive floods or flows. Calculated vulnerability is high if we examine structural criteria alone.

In the kabul river basin (92 605 km(2)), large-scale riverine and flash floods caused destructive damage with more than 1100 casualties. This study analysed rainfall-runoff and inundation in the kabul river basin with a newly developed model that simulates the processes of rainfall-runoff and inundation simultaneously based on two-dimensional diffusion wave equations. The simulation results showed a good agreement with an inundation map produced based on modis for large-scale riverine flooding. In addition, the simulation identified flash flood-affected areas, which were confirmed to be severely damaged based on a housing damage distribution map. Since the model is designed to be used even immediately after a disaster, it can be a useful tool for analysing large-scale flooding and to provide supplemental information to agencies for relief operations.",FLOOD; REMOTE SENSING; RAINFALL-RUNOFF-INUNDATION; SUBSURFACE FLOW; TWO-DIMENSIONAL MODEL; DIFFUSION WAVE; INDUS RIVER; KABUL RIVER; PAKISTAN,RASTER-BASED MODEL; SIMULATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,52,"BATES PD, 2010, J HYDROL, V387, P33, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2010.03.027.;BATES PD, 2005, COAST ENG, V52, P793, DOI 10.1016/J.COASTALENG.2005.06.001.;BATES PD, 2000, J HYDROL, V236, P54, DOI 10.1016/S0022-1694(00)00278-X.;CASH JR, 1990, ACM T MATH SOFTWARE, V16, P201, DOI 10.1145/79505.79507.;CHOW V.T., 1973, J HYDRAULICS DIVISIO, P2023.;DA PAZ AR, 2011, HYDROL PROCESS, V25, P1498, DOI 10.1002/HYP.7926.;DEY B, 1989, NORD HYDROL, V20, P167.;DOLL P, 2003, J HYDROL, V270, P105, DOI 10.1016/S0022-1694(02)00283-4.;DUTTA D, 2007, HYDROL PROCESS, V21, P1223, DOI 10.1002/HYP.6682.;FAO, 2006, 103 FAO.;HAI PT, 2008, HYDROL PROCESS, V22, P1329, DOI 10.1002/HYP.6942.;HANASAKI N, 2006, J HYDROL, V327, P22, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2005.11.011.;HIRABAYASHI Y, 2008, HYDROLOG SCI J, V53, P754, DOI 10.1623/HYSJ.53.4.754.;HORRITT MS, 2001, HYDROL PROCESS, V15, P825, DOI 10.1002/HYP.188.ABS.;HORRITT MS, 2001, J HYDROL, V253, P239, DOI 10.1016/S0022-1694(01)00490-5.;HOUBEN G, 2009, HYDROGEOL J, V17, P665, DOI 10.1007/S10040-008-0377-Z.;HUNTER NM, 2007, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V90, P208, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2006.10.021.;HUNTER NM, 2005, ADV WATER RESOUR, V28, P975, DOI 10.1016/J.ADVWATRES.2005.03.007.;INOMATA H, 2010, ANN J HYDRAULIC ENG, P925.;IWASA Y., 1982, J NATURAL DISASTER S, V4, P1.;JSCE (JAPAN SOCIETY FOR CIVIL ENGINEERS), 1999, FORM HYDR JAP.;LEHNER B, 2008, EOS T AGU, V89, P93, DOI DOI 10.1029/2008E0100001.;MACK T.

308,Fernandez-Lavado C;Furdada G;Marques Ma,Geomorphological method in the elaboration of hazard maps for flash-floods in the municipality of jucuaran (el salvador),NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"This work deals with the elaboration of flood hazard maps. These maps reflect the areas prone to floods based on the effects of hurricane mitch in the municipality of jucuaran of el salvador. Stream channels located in the coastal range in the se of el salvador flow into the pacific ocean and generate alluvial fans. Communities often inhabit these fans can be affected by floods. The geomorphology of these stream basins is associated with small areas, steep slopes, well developed regolite and extensive deforestation. These features play a key role in the generation of flash-floods. This zone lacks comprehensive rainfall data and gauging stations. The most detailed topographic maps are on a scale of 1:25 000. Given that the scale was not sufficiently detailed, we used aerial photographs enlarged to the scale of 1:8000. The effects of hurricane mitch mapped on these photographs were regarded as the reference event. Flood maps have a dual purpose (1) community emergency plans, (2) regional land use planning carried out by local authorities. The geomorphological method is based on mapping the geomorphological evidence (alluvial fans, preferential stream channels, erosion and sedimentation, man-made terraces). Following the interpretation of the photographs this information was validated on the field and complemented by eyewitness reports such as the height of water and flow typology. In addition, community workshops were organized to obtain information about the evolution and the impact of the phenomena. The superimposition of this information enables us to obtain a comprehensive geomorphological map. Another aim of the study was the calculation of the peak discharge using the manning and the paleohydraulic methods and estimates based on geomorphologic criterion. The results were compared with those obtained using the rational method. Significant differences in the order of magnitude of the calculated discharges were noted. The rational method underestimated the results owing to short and discontinuous periods of rainfall data with the result that probabilistic equations cannot be applied. The manning method yields a wide range of results because of its dependence on the roughness coefficient. The paleohydraulic method yielded higher values than the rational and manning methods. However, it should be pointed out that it is possible that bigger boulders could have been moved had they existed. These discharge values are lower than those obtained by the geomorphological estimates, i.e. Much closer to reality. The flood hazard maps were derived from the comprehensive geomorphological map. Three categories of hazard were established (very high, high and moderate) using flood energy, water height and velocity flow deduced from geomorphological and eyewitness reports.",,DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,10,"ALCANTARA-AYALA I, 2002, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V47, P107, DOI 10.1016/S0169-555X(02)00083-1.;ALCOVERRO J, 1999, ENG GEOL, V51, P237, DOI 10.1016/S0013-7952(98)00076-3.;ARNAUDFASSETTA G, 2004, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V66, P41.;AYALACARCEDO FJ, 2001, RIESGOS NATURALES PE.;BALLAIS JL, 2005, CR GEOSCI, V337, P1120, DOI 10.1016/J.CRTE.2005.06.010.;BENSON MA, 1967, US GEOL SURV TECHN W, PA1.;CAMARASA AM, 2001, FLOOD EVENTS MEDITER, V45, P229.;CHOW V.

396,Coller Mlf;Wheeler P;Kunapo J;Peterson J,Interactive flood hazard visualisation in adobe flash,JOURNAL OF FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT,"Advances in analytical flood modelling need to be accompanied by similar advances in the means by which model results can be disseminated across a wide range of stakeholder groups. In this paper, we exemplify the use of adobe flash as a means to design interactive flood mapping methods that can portray a wide range of potential flood levels, and place them into a context of flood frequency. We apply this methodology to a coastal flood-prone locality in australia, integrating a range of flood-related information into a single intuitive interface. We demonstrate how a temporal dimension can be incorporated to represent future changes to inundation probability based on climate change projections of sea-level rise.

While the measurement of urban disaster resilience has recently gained much attention, there is so far no optimal approach for operationalizing this concept and therefore there is a need to conduct more empirical studies on what constitutes disaster resilience and how to assess it. In this study, a resilience assessment focuses on the inherent characteristics and capacities of tehran in the context of flash floods from surface water or from the overflow of rivers. The measurement approach is based on constructing a composite index based on six resilience dimensions social, economic, institutional, infrastructural, community capital and environmental of community flood resilience. This follows by developing a hybrid multi-criteria decision-making method. The applied method is a combination of the ahp for prioritizing the selected indicators and the topsis tools in order to get tehran's urban districts ranked based on their resilience levels. Data were mostly from the statistical center of iran and tehran municipality's accessible data sources. The results clarify that districts 6 and 22 are comparatively the most resilient districts, while district 1 is the only district with the lowest level of resilience. Such place-based assessments have an opportunity to track community performance over time and provide the tool to decision-makers in order to integrate resilience thinking into urban development and resilience-oriented urban planning.",URBAN FLOOD RESILIENCE; COMPOSITE INDICATOR; AHP; TOPSIS; TEHRAN,COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; INDICATORS; VALIDATION; FRAMEWORK; TOPSIS; MODEL,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,11,none,"MOGHADAS, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), NUSSALLEE 1, D-53115 BONN, GERMANY.;MOGHADAS, MAHSA, ASADZADEH, ASAD, KOETTER, THEO, UNIV BONN, INST GEODESY \& GEOINFORMAT, URBAN PLANNING \& LAND MANAGEMENT GRP, NUSSALLEE 1, D-53115 BONN, GERMANY.;VAFEIDIS, ATHANASIOS, UNIV KIEL, INST GEOG, LUDEWIG MEYN STR 14, D-24098 KIEL, GERMANY.;FEKETE, ALEXANDER, COLOGNE UNIV APPL SCI, INST RESCUE ENGN \& CIVIL PROTECT, BETZDORFER STR 2, D-50679 COLOGNE, GERMANY.",10.1016/J.IJDRR.2019.101069,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,,2212-4209,,,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,35,2019,ISI000463034000010,88,"GEOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",26,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",M.MOGHADASIGG.UNI-BONN.DE,,HR3JW,,"MOGHADAS, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), NUSSALLEE 1, D-53115 BONN, GERMANY",ISI,UNIV BONN;UNIV KIEL;COLOGNE UNIV APPL SCI,NOTREPORTED,,"MOGHADAS M, 2019, INT J DISASTER RISK REDUCT","MOGHADAS M, 2019, INT J DISASTER RISK REDUCT",FALSE,1,0,1,0,0,2_5_6,3_5_11,1,4

Participatory rural appraisal (pra) tools were applied by the social science team. The results were validated with a hazard map prepared by a separate team comprised of geologists. Turtuk, the northernmost village in ladakh, india located near the line of control with pakistan was undertaken as a case study. Turtuk represents a high mountain indigenous rural community which has experienced several catastrophic disasters (flash flooding and landslides in 2010, 2014, and 2015) and territorial armed conflicts (wars in 1971 and 1999 with pakistan) in recent times. The villagers were able to identify various environmental hazards and associated risk zones through participatory timeline diagram, and hazard and dream mapping exercises. The pra maps matched the geological hazard map of turtuk, demonstrating that community people are highly aware of surrounding hazards regardless of differences in age, sex, education, occupation, and religion. They apply indigenous knowledge to deal with the adverse climate and calamities. The technique, of analysing community vulnerability in the context of conflict and disasters by applying qualitative pra tools and validating the mapping results, as piloted in this study is novel and replicable in any disaster setting.",PARTICIPATORY RURAL APPRAISAL; HINDU KUSH HIMALAYA; WAR; LANDSLIDES; LINE OF CONTROL; INDIA,NATURAL HAZARDS; DISASTER; FLOOD; VULNERABILITY; POPULATION; LANDSLIDES; EARTHQUAKE; STRATEGIES; KNOWLEDGE; PROVINCE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,none,"AHMED, B (REPRINT AUTHOR), UCL, UCL HUMANITARIAN INST, LONDON WC1E 6BT, ENGLAND.;AHMED, BAYES, SAMMONDS, PETER, UCL, INST RISK \& DISASTER REDUCT, LONDON, ENGLAND.;AHMED, BAYES, SAMMONDS, PETER, UCL, UCL HUMANITARIAN INST, LONDON WC1E 6BT, ENGLAND.;SAMMONDS, PETER, THUSU, BINDRA, UCL, DEPT EARTH SCI, LONDON, ENGLAND.;SAVILLE, NAOMI M., UCL, INST GLOBAL HLTH, LONDON, ENGLAND.;LE MASSON, VIRGINIE, ODI, LONDON, ENGLAND.;SURI, KAVITA, UNIV JAMMU, DEPT LIFELONG LEARNING, JAMMU, JAMMU \& KASHMIR, INDIA.;BHAT, GHULAM M., HAKHOO, NAVEEN, UNIV JAMMU, INST ENERGY RES \& TRAINING, JAMMU, JAMMU \& KASHMIR, INDIA.;JOLDEN, TSERING, UNIV JAMMU, DEPT SOCIOL, JAMMU, JAMMU \& KASHMIR, INDIA.;HUSSAIN, GULZAR, UNIV JAMMU, DEPT GEOL, JAMMU, JAMMU \& KASHMIR, INDIA.;WANGMO, KUENGA, ROYAL UNIV BHUTAN, CTR ARCHAEOL \& HIST STUDIES, THIMPHU, BHUTAN.",10.1016/J.IJDRR.2019.01.002,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,NATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCIL (NERC)NERC NATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCIL; ARTS \& HUMANITIES RESEARCH COUNCIL (AHRC); ECONOMIC \& SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL (ESRC)ECONOMIC \& SOCIAL RESEARCH COUNCIL (ESRC) [NE/P016138/1],,2212-4209,,,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,35,2019,ISI000463034000005,70,"GEOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",3,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",BAYES.AHMEDUCL.AC.UK P.SAMMONDSUCL.AC.UK N.SAVILLEUCL.AC.UK V.LEMASSONODI.ORG.UK BHATGMJUGAA.COM NAVEENJUGAA.COM B.THUSUUCL.AC.UK,,HR3JW,,"AHMED, B (REPRINT AUTHOR), UCL, UCL HUMANITARIAN INST, LONDON WC1E 6BT, ENGLAND",ISI,INST RISK AND DISASTER REDUCT;UCL HUMANITARIAN INST;DEPT EARTH SCI;INST GLOBAL HLTH;UNIV JAMMU;UNIV JAMMU;UNIV JAMMU;UNIV JAMMU;ROYAL UNIV BHUTAN,UCL HUMANITARIAN INST,,"AHMED B, 2019, INT J DISASTER RISK REDUCT","AHMED B, 2019, INT J DISASTER RISK REDUCT",FALSE,0,5,3,0,0,0,3_5_6,2,5

This web platform uses open-source geospatial software and technologies, particularly the boundless (formerly opengeo) framework and its client side software development kit (sdk). The main purpose of the platform is to assist the experts and stakeholders in the decision-making process for evaluation and selection of different risk management strategies through an interactive participation approach, integrating web-gis interface with decision support tool based on a compromise programming approach. The access rights and functionality of the platform are varied depending on the roles and responsibilities of stakeholders in managing the risk. The application of the prototype platform is demonstrated based on an example case study site: malborghetto valbruna municipality of north-eastern italy where flash floods and landslides are frequent with major events having occurred in 2003.

Of these, lahars and flash floods, triggered by occasional torrential rainfall, pose the most frequently occurring hazards that can affect the city and its environs, in particular the areas containing low-income neighbourhoods. This paper presents and discusses criteria for delineating areas prone to flash flood and lahar hazards, which are localized along the usually dry (except for the rainy season) ravines and channels of the rio chili and its tributaries that dissect the city. Our risk-evaluation study is based mostly on field surveys and mapping, but we also took into account quality and structural integrity of buildings, available socioeconomic data, and information gained from interviews with risk-managers officials. In our evaluation of the vulnerability of various parts of the city, in addition to geological and physical parameters, we also took into account selected socio-economic parameters, such as the educational and poverty level of the population, unemployment figures, and population density. In addition, we utilized a criterion of the ``isolation factor, based on distances to access emergency resources (hospitals, shelters or safety areas, and water) in each city block. By combining the hazard, vulnerability and exposure criteria, we produced detailed risk-zone maps at the city-block scale, covering the whole city of arequipa and adjacent suburbs. Not surprisingly, these maps show that the areas at high risk coincide with blocks or districts with populations at low socioeconomic levels. Inhabitants at greatest risk are the poor recent immigrants from rural areas who live in unauthorized settlements in the outskirts of the city in the upper parts of the valleys. Such settlements are highly exposed to natural hazards and have little access to vital resources. Our study provides good rationale for the risk zoning of the city, which in turn may be used as an educational tool for better understanding the potential effects of natural hazards and the exposure of the population residing in and around arequipa. We hope that our work and the risk-zonation maps will provide the impetus and basis for risk-management authorities of the municipality and the regional government of arequipa to enforce existing regulations in building in hazardous zones and to adopt an effective long-term strategy to reduce risks from lahar, flash flood, and other natural hazards.",,MISTI-VOLCANO; EL-MISTI,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,13,"BLAIKIE P, 2004, RISK NATURAL HAZARDS.;CANNON T, 1993, NATURAL DISASTERS PR.;COBENAS G., 2012, GEOTHERM RES, V241-242, P106.;CUTTER SL, 2003, SOC SCI QUART, V84, P242, DOI 10.1111/1540-6237.8402002.;DA CUNHA J.

221,Pal I;Tularug P;Jana Sk;Pal Dk,Risk assessment and reduction measures in landslide and flash flood-prone areas: a case of southern thailand (nakhon si thammarat province),INTEGRATING DISASTER SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT: GLOBAL CASE STUDIES IN MITIGATION AND RECOVERY,"The purpose of this study is to analyze the degree of risk and vulnerability in the community susceptible to landslide and flash floods in Sichon district, Nakhon Si Thammarat province, Thailand. The focus of this study is to analyze and understand the socioeconomic vulnerability of the community at the household level and to assess the risk and vulnerability of the community by risk assessment. All the tasks were performed to make a measure for community-based disaster risk reduction activities.

To analyze the degree of risk and vulnerability in landslide and flash flood-prone areas in Thepparat community, the risk assessment has been done acquiring the information from field survey, questionnaire survey, and key informant interviews. The risk analysis has been conducted by risk assessment matrix combined with geographic information system to analyze the spatial data and landslide and flash flood risk maps. The landslide factors developed from the Thai Department of Mineral Resource data have resulted in landslide susceptibility index. However, the community susceptible to flash floods has been identified by creating buffer zones in digital maps to explain the vulnerability and exposure of residents. In addition, the villages are also clustered into three zones as high-, moderate-, and low-risk zones. The study recommends the multihazard risk reduction measures based on the outcome of risk analysis of the community. The recommendations are primarily focused on the improvements of existing programs such as early warning system, local-level capacity development, and community training. The study also explored some of the nonstructural measures in the context of community-based disaster risk management, disaster management courses in school teaching, and community awareness to build a resilient community.",,,ENGLISH,"ARTICLE, BOOK CHAPTER",INCOLLECTION,0,"ADPC, 2009, US RISK ASS RED LAND, P1.;CENTER FOR EXCELLENCE IN DISASTER MANAGEMENT \& HUMANITARIAN ASSISTANCE, 2015, DIS MAN REF HDB.;DEFRA, 2011, UND RISK EMP COMM BU.;EM-DAT, 2015, ENV SCI POL SUST DEV, V21, P14.;GROTHMANN T, 2006, NAT HAZARDS, V38, P101, DOI 10.1007/S11069-005-8604-6.;PAL I, 2015, USE LAND COVER CHANG, P125.;PAL I, 2013, INT J SCIRES PUBL, V3, P10.;PAL I, 2017, INT J DISAST RISK RE, V21, P350, DOI 10.1016/J.IJDRR.2017.01.002.;PANEETSIN K., 2014, THESIS ASIAN I TECHN.;PEGGION M., 2008, GEOGRAPHIC INFORM SY.;PRAMOJANEE P, 1997, P INT C GEOINF SUST, P198.;PRAMOJANEE P., 2013, P INT C GEO INF SUST, P198.;SLOVIC P., 1979, RATING RISKS SYSTEM.;THAI METEOROLOGICAL DEPARTMENT, 2015, ANN WEATH SUMM THAIL.;UNDP, 2010, DIS RISK ASS BUR CRI.","PAL, I (REPRINT AUTHOR), ASIAN INST TECHNOL, DISASTER PREPAREDNESS MITIGAT \& MANAGEMENT DPMM, KHLONG NUENG, THAILAND.;PAL, INDRAJIT, TULARUG, PONGPAIBOON, ASIAN INST TECHNOL, DISASTER PREPAREDNESS MITIGAT \& MANAGEMENT DPMM, KHLONG NUENG, THAILAND.;JANA, SUJOY KUMAR, PAL, DILIP KUMAR, PAPUA NEW GUINEA UNIV TECHNOL, DEPT SURVEYING \& LAND STUDIES, LAE, PAPUA N GUINEA.",10.1016/B978-0-12-812056-9.00017-8,"SARA BURGERHARTSTRAAT 25, PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","SAMUI, P AND KIM, D AND GHOSH, C",,"978-0-12-812057-6, 978-0-12-812056-9",,,295-308,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,,2018,ISI000463377500018,15,"GEOLOGY, PUBLIC, ENVIRONMENTAL \& OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH",0,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, PUBLIC, ENVIRONMENTAL \& OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH",,,BM4IR,INTEGRATING DISASTER SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT: GLOBAL CASE STUDIES IN MITIGATION AND RECOVERY,"PAL, I (REPRINT AUTHOR), ASIAN INST TECHNOL, DISASTER PREPAREDNESS MITIGAT \& MANAGEMENT DPMM, KHLONG NUENG, THAILAND",ISI,ASIAN INST TECHNOL;PAPUA NEW GUINEA UNIV TECHNOL,ASIAN INST TECHNOL,,"PAL I, 2018, INTEGRATING DISASTER SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT: GLOBAL CASE STUDIES IN MITIGATION AND RECOVERY","PAL I, 2018, INTEGRATING DISASTER SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT: GLOBAL CASE STUDIES IN MITIGATION AND RECOVERY",FALSE,0,0,1,0,0,0,3_6,2,5
374,Li Y;Liu C,A gis-based procedure for measuring the efects of the built environment on urban flash floods,JOURNAL OF GREEN BUILDING,"Urban flooding has been a severe problem for many cities around the world as it remains one of the greatest threats to the property and safety of human communities. In australia, it is seen as the most expensive natural hazard. However, urban areas that are impervious to rainwater have been sharply increasing owing to booming construction activities and rapid urbanisation. The change in the built environment may cause more frequent and longer duration of flooding in floodprone urban regions. Thus, the flood inundation issue associated with the effects of land uses needs to be explored and developed. This research constructs a framework for modelling urban flood inundation. Different rainfall events are then designed for examining the impact on flash floods generated by land-use changes. Measurement is formulated for changes of topographical features over a real time series. Geographic information system (gis) technologies are then utilised to visualise the effects of land-use changes on flood inundation under different types of storms. Based on a community-based case study, the results reveal that the built environment leads to varying degrees of aggravation of urban flash floods with different storm events and a few rainwater storage units may slightly mitigate flooding extents under different storm conditions. Hence, it is recommended that the outcomes of this study could be applied to flood assessment measures for urban development and the attained results could be utilised in government planning to raise awareness of flood hazard.",LAND USE; GIS; NUMERICAL SIMULATION; FACILITY CONSTRUCTION; STORMWATER MANAGEMENT,SCS-CN METHOD; INUNDATION; SIMULATION; IMPACT; INDIA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"[ANONYMOUS], 2011, ABC NEWS.;[ANONYMOUS], 1993, DES CONSTR URB STORM, V77.;BOM, 2013, NAT ARR FLOOD FOR WA.;BOM, 2015, SUM SIGN SEV THUND E.;BOM, 2015, DES RAINF INT CHART.;BRODY S, 2014, J ENVIRON PLANN MAN, V57, P1252, DOI 10.1080/09640568.2013.802228.;BRODY SD, 2008, DISASTERS, V32, P1, DOI [10.1111/J.1467-7717.2007.01024.X, 10.1111/J.0361-3666.2007.01024.X].;BUREAU OF METEROROLOGY (BOM), 2015, CLIM DAT ONL.;CARBONE D, 2013, AUSTR GEOGRAPHIC.;CHEN J, 2009, J HYDROL, V373, P184, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2009.04.021.;CHOW V.

The area selected for the study district upper dir is a rural and relatively backward region located in northwestern pakistan, in khyber-pakhtunkhwa province. The study area is undergoing severe deforestation and natural disasters in the recent past. The study consists of two stages, in first stage the traditional geographical information system image was used to analyze the spatial-temporal situation of the surroundings. In the second stage, well-designed questionnaire was used to collect the primary information from 420 randomly selected households of research areas. A multidimensional poverty index has been used to measure the poverty profile of the population. It has been found that 55\% households were below the poverty line. Almost, 95\% households are using wood for cooking purposes. High dependence on natural resources causes forest cover degradation while burning off too much wood causes co2 emission and leads to environmental degradation. A major portion of population is living on steeply sloped areas with certain risks. It is found that frequency of flash flood is 53\% and agricultural land (54\%) is at high risk and often flows with flash floods. It is concluded that there is strong correlation between multidimensional poverty and forest cover degradation which leads to climate and environmental risks.",MULTIDIMENSIONAL POVERTY; FOREST DEGRADATION; FLASH FLOODS; ENVIRONMENTAL RISK; CO2 EMISSION; CLIMATE,FOREST DEGRADATION; HOUSEHOLD WELFARE; LINKS EVIDENCE; LIVELIHOODS; DEPENDENCE; CHARCOAL; REGION; IMPACT; PERU,ENGLISH,"ARTICLE, EARLY ACCESS",ARTICLE,0,none,"SAQIB, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV MONTPELLIER, MONTPELLIER RES ECON, MONTPELLIER, FRANCE.;KHAN, IRUM, INST MANAGEMENT SCI, PESHAWAR, PAKISTAN.;SAQIB, MUHAMMAD, UNIV MONTPELLIER, MONTPELLIER RES ECON, MONTPELLIER, FRANCE.;HAFIDI, HOUDA, UNIV MONTPELLIER, CTR ENVIRONM ECON, MONTPELLIER, FRANCE.",10.1007/S10708-019-10090-6,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,,0343-2521,,,SPRINGER,,,ISI000490205400001,58,GEOGRAPHY,6,GEOGRAPHY,IIRUMKHANGMAIL.COM VISITSAQIBGMAIL.COM HOUDA.HAFIDI21GMAIL.COM,,JD8BG,,"SAQIB, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV MONTPELLIER, MONTPELLIER RES ECON, MONTPELLIER, FRANCE",ISI,INST MANAGEMENT SCI;UNIV MONTPELLIER;UNIV MONTPELLIER,UNIV MONTPELLIER,,"KHAN I, NA, GEOJOURNAL","KHAN I, NA, GEOJOURNAL",FALSE,0,3,0,0,0,2_3,3_6,2,1

This study aimed to evaluate the region's early warning system (ews) for flash floods. We used an adapted version of the questionnaire developed by the united nations international strategy for disaster reduction. We reviewed documents on the ews of golestan, and conducted a qualitative study comprising interviews with experts and affected people in kalaleh and minoodasht. Results were discussed by an expert panel. Regarding risk knowledge, there was a hazard map at provincial disaster taskforce (pdt) drawn by the provincial office for water resource management, but no risk analysis was available. Local people were aware of their exposure to flooding, but not aware of the existence of a hazard map and their vulnerability situation. In terms of monitoring and warning, pdt faced serious limitations in issuing early warnings, including (1) an inability to make point predictions of rainfall, and (2) the absence of a warning threshold. Dissemination and communication issued by the meteorological office followed a top-to-bottom direction. The contents were neither clearly understood by other institutions nor reached the potential recipients within an appropriate time frame. There was a need for a comprehensive response plan with adequate exercises, and no evaluation framework existed. Golestan ews is in dire need of improvement.

The short time available for minimising risks requires preparedness and active response. In this context of risk management, the flood risk perception of the local population is the first step towards achieving resilience of people and communities. Although flood risk perception has intrinsic spatial variability, few previous studies take this into account. This paper explores the spatial variability of flash flood risk perception in the village of navaluenga in central spain, using nonparametric and multivariate geostatistical tools. How local people perceived the flash flood risk to their homes was assessed interviewing a representative sample. Results show that considering these flash flood risk related spatial variables enhances people's psychological interpretation of risk perception: the perception of flash flood risk in a short time event is congruent with those spatial variables. These findings determine priority areas for future risk communication plans. They could also be extrapolated to other urban areas with a similar hydrographic configuration, when there is a flood hazard from a main river and potentially flooded minor water courses, which are even closer to houses but are not considered dangerous by the local population.",FLASH FLOOD; NATURAL FLOOD MANAGEMENT; RESILIENCE; RISK COMMUNICATION,PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTANCE; MENTAL MODELS; COMMUNICATION; HAZARD; PREPAREDNESS; UNCERTAINTY; ASSESSMENTS; LIDAR,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"GUARDIOLA-ALBERT, C (REPRINT AUTHOR), INST GEOL \& MINERO ESPANA, DEPT RES GEOL RESOURCES, MADRID, SPAIN.;GUARDIOLA-ALBERT, CAROLINA, NARANJO-FERNANDEZ, NURIA, INST GEOL \& MINERO ESPANA, DEPT RES GEOL RESOURCES, MADRID, SPAIN.;DIEZ-HERRERO, ANDRES, INST GEOL \& MINERO ESPANA, DEPT RES \& GEOSCI PROSPECT, MADRID, SPAIN.;AMERIGO CUERVO-ARANGO, MARIA, GARCIA, JUAN A., UNIV CASTILLA LA MANCHA CAMPUS TOLEDO, FAC HUMANIDADES, TOLEDO, SPAIN.;MARIA BODOQUE, JOSE, AROCA-JIMENEZ, ESTEFANIA, UNIV CASTILLA LA MANCHA CAMPUS TOLEDO, TOLEDO, SPAIN.",10.1111/JFR3.12590,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,"CONSEJERIA DE EDUCACION, JUVENTUD Y DEPORTE, COMUNIDAD DE MADRID [PEJ15/AMB/AI-0218]; MINISTERIO DE CIENCIA, INNOVACION Y UNIVERSIDADES [CGL2017-83546-C3-R]; MINISTERIO DE ECONOMIA Y COMPETITIVIDADSPANISH GOVERNMENT [CGL2013-42728-R]",,1753-318X,1,,WILEY,13,2020,ISI000506090600001,55,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, WATER RESOURCES",4,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",C.GUARDIOLAIGME.ES,,KM6ZZ,,"GUARDIOLA-ALBERT, C (REPRINT AUTHOR), INST GEOL \& MINERO ESPANA, DEPT RES GEOL RESOURCES, MADRID, SPAIN",ISI,INST GEOL AND MINERO ESPANA;INST GEOL AND MINERO ESPANA;UNIV CASTILLA LA MANCHA CAMPUS TOLEDO;UNIV CASTILLA LA MANCHA CAMPUS TOLEDO,INST GEOL AND MINERO ESPANA,,"GUARDIOLA-ALBERT C, 2020, J FLOOD RISK MANAG","GUARDIOLA-ALBERT C, 2020, J FLOOD RISK MANAG",FALSE,1,0,3,0,0,0,3_6_11,1,1

Questionnaire based survey and structured interviews were conducted to investigate physical and economic damages in the selected case study dir valley. Global positioning system (gps) survey was also conducted to acquire location of damages and geographical information system (gis) is used to visualize land use, land cover and damage data. Buffer analysis is used to delineate the effected strata on both sides of panjkora river to assess the flood damages. Climate change phenomenon along with peculiar topography of the region are considered as the underlying causes as monsoon winds interacted with the jet stream abnormally causing unprecedented high intensity rainfall in the valley. The steep topography of the area caused rain water to accumulate rapidly in the panjkora river, overpowering the withholding capacity of the river. The phenomenon resulted in severe flash flood which annihilated whatever came in its way. Upper zone in the target area is badly affected by flood with maximum damaged houses and human causalities followed by lower zone with high number of damaged bridges.

165,Sun Y;Zhou H;Wall G;Wei Y,Cognition of disaster risk in a tourism community: an agricultural heritage system perspective,JOURNAL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM,"Cognition of risk is the first step in reducing disaster damage and losses. In this study, risk cognition in the hani rice terraces, the core tourism attraction in yuanyang county, honghe prefecture, yunnan, china, is analyzed based on field survey and participatory geographic information system (gis). The results show that tourism communities have cognition of risk, are more sensitive to hazards (especially drought), have more severe potential damage and losses from hazards, and also have more enthusiasm to adapt to disaster risk, when compared with a non-tourism community. On disaster vulnerability maps, the tourism communities identified the unique ``forest - village - terrace - river landscape while the non-tourism community only recognized the terrace and the village as the main elements affected by hazard. Also, the tourism communities had deeper understandings of drought, flash floods and landslide disaster risks. A conceptual model based on ``pressure - state - response relationships is put forward to explore the situation in which, in the tourism community, terraces have a greater variety of functions and enhanced values resulting in the spatial expansion of hazard effects.",COGNITION; DISASTER RISK; TOURISM COMMUNITY; HANI RICE TERRACES; CHINA,PERCEPTION; MITIGATION; FRAMEWORK; RESPONSES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,"ASIAN DISASTER PREPAREDNESS CENTER, 2006, CRIT GUID COMM BAS D.;ASIAN DISASTER PREPAREDNESS CENTER, 2006, MED KIT COMM BAS DIS.;BECK U, 1992, RISK SOC NEW MODERNI.;BECK U, 2006, ECON SOC, V35, P329, DOI 10.1080/03085140600844902.;BECKEN S, 2013, TOURISM MANAGE, V36, P77, DOI 10.1016/J.TOURMAN.2012.11.006.;BIRD DK, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P1307, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-1307-2009.;BURTON I., 1978, ENV HAZARD.;BURTON I, 1969, 115 U CHIC DEP GEOGR.;DAHAL KR, 2011, ENVIRON HAZARDS-UK, V10, P154, DOI 10.1080/17477891.2011.582310.;EISER JR, 2012, INT J DISAST RISK RE, V1, P5, DOI 10.1016/J.IJDRR.2012.05.002.;FAULKNER B, 2001, TOURISM MANAGE, V22, P135, DOI 10.1016/S0261-5177(00)00048-0.;FIELD C.B., 2014, GLOBAL SECTORAL AS A, P35.;FREWER L.J, 2001, RISK COMMUNICATION P, P21.;GAILLARD JC, 2008, J VOLCANOL GEOTH RES, V172, P315, DOI 10.1016/J.JVOLGEORES.2007.12.036.;GIGERENZE G, 2000, ADAPTIVE THINKING RA.;GOLLEDGE RG, 1987, ANAL BEHAV GEOGRAPHY.;HUGHEY KFD, 2016, TOUR MANAG PERSPECT, V19, P69, DOI 10.1016/J.TMP.2016.03.003.;INTERNATIONAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE, 2007, SUMM POL CLIM CHANG.;[ JIAO YUANMEI], 2002, [, JOURNAL OF MOUNTAIN SCIENCE], V20, P266.;KAHNEMAN D, 1979, ECONOMETRICA, V47, P263, DOI 10.2307/1914185.;LAWS E., 2006, TOURISM CRISES MANAG.;LIU J., 2012, RES PUBLIC SERVICE S.;MAURO M.D., 2014, INT J DISASTER RISK, V10, P403.;MERCADO RM, 2016, PROCEDIA ENVIRON SCI, V34, P490, DOI 10.1016/J.PROENV.2016.04.043.;MURPHY P.

Malaysia is located in a tropical region characterized by high quantity of rainfall. Damaged roads due to flooding prevent access for emergency and assistance purpose. The purpose of this study is to identify the flooding characteristics of inundated roads in malaysia. It includes the parameters of flood water level, flood duration, and repeated flooding. Secondary data from relevant departments and agencies are gathered for the analysis. Flood statistics were obtained from the annual flood reports issued by the department of irrigation and drainage malaysia between 1991 and 2014. Road data as well as maps were collected from the highway planning division, ministry of works malaysia. In this study, flash flood was defined as flood that subsides in less than 6 hr. The study revealed that the average flood depths could be grouped into 0.3 m, 0.6 m and 1.0 m depths. However, in areas under tidal effect, the depths could exceed 1.0 m and it took longer for the flood to subside, up to two days. The result of this characterisation will be used to expand the study on the effect of inundated roads during flooding on the whole road structural system.",FLOODING; ROAD; ROAD INUNDATION,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,none,"GHANI, ANA (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV SAINS MALAYSIA, SCH HOUSING BLDG \& PLANNING, GEORGE TOWN, MALAYSIA.;ISMAIL, MUHD SHAHRIL NIZAM, GHANI, ABDUL NASER ABDUL, UNIV SAINS MALAYSIA, SCH HOUSING BLDG \& PLANNING, GEORGE TOWN, MALAYSIA.;GHAZALY, ZUHAYR MD, UNIV MALAYSIA PERLIS, SCH ENVIRONM ENGN, ARAU, PERLIS, MALAYSIA.",10.21660/2019.54.4827,"MIE UNIV, GRAD SCH OF BIORESOURCES, TSU CITY, MIE 514-8507, JAPAN",,UNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIAUNIVERSITI SAINS MALAYSIA [FRGS 1/2017: 203.PPBGN.6711611]; MOHEMINISTRY OF HIGHER EDUCATION \& SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH (MHESR) [FRGS 1/2017: 203.PPBGN.6711611],,2186-2982,54,129-133,GEOMATE INT SOC,16,2019,ISI000455518700020,12,ENGINEERING,1,"ENGINEERING, CIVIL",,,HH1ZP,,"GHANI, ANA (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV SAINS MALAYSIA, SCH HOUSING BLDG \& PLANNING, GEORGE TOWN, MALAYSIA",ISI,UNIV SAINS MALAYSIA;UNIV MALAYSIA PERLIS,UNIV SAINS MALAYSIA,,"ISMAIL MSN, 2019, INT J GEOMATE","ISMAIL MSN, 2019, INT J GEOMATE",FALSE,0,7,0,0,0,6,3_8,0,2
57,Vinet F,Geographical analysis of damage due to flash floods in southern france: the cases of 12-13 november 1999 and 8-9 september 2002,APPLIED GEOGRAPHY,"The southern part of france near the mediterranean sea is subject to flash floods generated by heavy rainfalls typical of the mediterranean climate. In november 1999 (the 12th and 13th) and in september 2002 (the 8th and 9th), 5000 kin 2 were touched by rainfalls superior to 200mm in the departments of aude and gard. In both cases, maximum precipitation exceeded 500 min within 24 h. The damage amounted in the hundreds of millions of euros, and there were numerous fatalities: 35 in 1999, and 23 in 2002. Following a survey of available data, this article details the cost of the damage for both flash flood events. The distribution of the damage is quantified by sector of activity (e.g., industry, agriculture). The average ratio ``euros of loss per inhabitant is quite similar in both cases, but this average hides some geographical discrepancies. Losses in industry can locally worsen the overall toll. The mapping of damage on a local scale and the amount of losses per inhabitant demonstrate that rural areas underwent heavy losses. This was mostly due to the destruction of the public infrastructures (e.g., roads, bridges) that represented more than half of the overall loss. In some rural areas, the cost of flash floods can exceed 15,000 euros per inhabitant. Such flood prevention issues as flood warning systems and land use planning must not focus only on the cities. Death, injury and heavy material losses also disadvantage the rural and mountainous areas where populations and activities are concentrated near rivers. (C) 2008 elsevier ltd.

This developed methodology takes advantage of geographic information systems software to integrate its strength to manage the flood impacts. This approach is of dual purpose: first, to reduce the flash flood hazard of hill torrents, and second, to make use of flood water as a source of irrigation by conserving flood water in an earthen reservoir. The developed integrated methodology works as a decision-making system for selection of best site selection for earthen reservoir. The results for three potential sites for earthen reservoir supports in a decision-making process for best site for reservoir by analysing calculations for storage capacity, earthen works, and lengths of canals from reservoirs to agricultural land. This study investigated that the tools of geoinformatics have the potential to resolve the engineering challenges linked with mitigation of flood hazards.

53,Terti G;Ruin I;Anquetin S;Gourley Jj,Dynamic vulnerability factors for impact-based flash flood prediction,NATURAL HAZARDS,"Social vulnerability explains the sociological and human-dependent circumstances that translate a natural event into a deadly disaster. But, what are the space-time characteristics of vulnerability (i.e., dynamic vulnerability) that influence how people are impacted by a specific natural hazard? This paper performs a critical analysis of previous flood-related human impact and vulnerability studies to better understand and summarize the human-related factors that determine the impacts from flash flood events. The paper is motivated by the hypothesis that the intersection of the spatiotemporal context of the hazard with the distribution of people and their characteristics across space and time reveals different paths of vulnerability and defines the most probable space of an exposed area in terms of deadly impacts. Based on this idea, a conceptual model for assessing vulnerability to flash flooding is developed and presented herein. The most important advance of the current research in comparison with previous efforts in vulnerability assessment is the introduction of the concept of the spatial and temporal variability of vulnerability. This means that the proposed conceptual model does not consider vulnerability as a static synopsis that can be described by a single map, but as an ever-evolving process derived from the interaction of social and physical dynamics. The dynamic perspective of vulnerability is key for the identification of pertinent vulnerability variables to be used for flash flood vulnerability assessment and dynamic mapping, and prediction.",VULNERABILITY MODEL; SOCIAL PROCESSES; IMPACT FORECASTING; SPACE-TIME FACTORS; FLASH FLOOD EVENTS,SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; FATALITIES; PARAMETERS; AUSTRALIA; COUNTY; US,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,26,"ADGER WN, 2006, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V16, P268, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2006.02.006.;AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY, 2000, B AM METEOROL SOC, V81, P1338.;ANDERSON M.

212,Gebbeken N;Videkhina I;Pfeiffer E;Garsch M;Ruediger L,Risk assessment and protection of the built infrastructure for flood eventshochwassergefahr,BAUTECHNIK,"Risk assessment and protection of the built infrastructure for flood events the increase in number, intensity and damage of extreme natural events is a growing threat to public security and for the built infrastructure. The following article explains the risk management with respect to flood. In the context of national and international research projects, the authors develop practical engineering-tools for a fast determination of the vulnerability of the built infrastructure, like public buildings and transport infrastructures, in order to derive risk assessments in disaster events and to provide decision support for rescue forces. The engineering-tools include, among other things, a decision-support-system with recommendations for strengthening and repairing of structures in the case of major flooding. Structures are evaluated with rapid analysis, but also with detailed numerical calculation. The research projects are interdisciplinary joint-research-projects and the authors are working at different aspects for the assessment of the built infrastructure. For the effects on built infrastructure during flood and for prevention of disaster events, there is no standardization at hand. There are just a few guidelines for the protection of structures for a flood event. For this reason load models for static and dynamic loads during a flood are developed, in order to create a basis for the assessment of robustness of structures. The determination of the remaining carrying capacity during and after a flood event is in the primary focus. This is the basis for the analysis of the resilience of the built infrastructure. In this article the implementation of the classical action strategy in disaster management (pre-, during-, post-incident) in a software-tool is presented and with that, innovative methods with geo-information-systems (gis) and 3d-city- and building models (bim) are shown.",FLOOD; FLASH FLOOD; NATURAL HAZARD; BUILT INFRASTRUCTURE; DISASTER MANAGEMENT; RISK MANAGEMENT; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; PROTECTIVE METHODS; ENGINEERING-TOOLS; 3D-CITY- AND BUILDING-MODELS (CITYGML/BIM IFC;GIS),,GERMAN,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"[ANONYMOUS], 2013, HOCHW OBJ BAUL VORS.;[ANONYMOUS], 2005, 41491198104 DIN.;[ANONYMOUS], 2005, MEG MEG TRENDS HER V.;[ANONYMOUS], 2007, BEWERTUNG MANAGEMENT.;[ANONYMOUS], 2002, HOCHW PLAN BAU GEB H.;[ANONYMOUS], 2006, 107 BOKU IAN.;[ANONYMOUS], 2003, FLOODRISKNET NEWSLET.;[ANONYMOUS], 2008, SCHUTZ KRIT INFR RIS.;[ANONYMOUS], 2015, EXPECT UNEXPECTED.;[ANONYMOUS], 2012, HOCHWASSER GEHT HOCH.;BERZ G., NATURKATASTROPHEN KL.;BOJANOWSKI A., 2013, UNO BERICHT KLIMAWAN, V5.;DISSE M., 2011, FACHBERATER HOCHWASS.;ELVERFELD K.

300,Alamdar F;Kalantari M;Rajabifard A,Towards multi-agency sensor information integration for disaster management,COMPUTERS ENVIRONMENT AND URBAN SYSTEMS,"Having access to real-time spatial information is central to the functioning of disaster management, and in particular disaster response. Existing spatially-enabled solutions for managing urban disasters provide limited support for time-sensitivity and urgency underlying emergency situations. These approaches mainly suffer from low temporal resolution and inability to source a broad range of required disaster data, together with insufficient support for automated operations. However, disaster management procedures, integrated with in situ sensing, promise an extensive range of real-time data and automated processes to acquire and manage disaster information. In this research, we study the process of integrating multi-agency in situ sensors for supporting disaster management. For this purpose, the research was adopted in australia as the case study area in disaster management of a flood by emphasizing on the response phase. This paper first identifies the issues and existing requirements in the process of multi-agency sensor information integration and then proposes a standard-based approach to overcoming these integration issues. Afterward, based on the presented approach and identified requirements, a gis-based software iddss-sensor is implemented to provide the functions of standard-based access, as well as on-the-fly harmonization, integration and usage of multi-agency sensor information. We evaluate the applicability of our developed approach by applying it to the use case of supporting flash flood evacuation response. (C) 2015 elsevier ltd.

572,Porta Gf;Bebbington M;Xiao X;Jones G,Bayesian lifetime analysis for landslide dams,LANDSLIDES,"Landslide dams are a common hazard which threaten downstream human settlement or infrastructure, as their collapse may result in a flash flood. The danger is compounded by the amount of water accumulated, therefore, estimation of the time to failure becomes crucial for assessing engineering risk mitigation procedures. Dam dimension indices, descriptive multivariate analysis and logistic regression have been used to produce a static image of the dam conditions, estimating the probability of failure, but they provide no information of when a failure might occur. We propose a bayesian model to predict the time to failure of landslide dams, based on imputing missing dam and reservoir measurements via an analysis of their covariate structure. The resulting data is then used in a bayesian survival model which links the (censored) failure time to dam and reservoir variables. A case study on heterogeneous italian events is presented, on which our model is tested. Results show that it is possible to produce a probabilistic model of time to failure. The length and height of dams, and the catchment area behind them, are identified as the most important covariates controlling the time to failure. The addition of area-based intercepts confirms the robustness of the methodology. Examples of potential results (forecasting) and possible generalizations of the model are presented.",LANDSLIDE DAMS; BAYESIAN SURVIVAL MODEL; TIME-TO-EVENT; ITALY,FAILURE; CLASSIFICATION; STABILITY; HAZARD,ENGLISH,"ARTICLE, EARLY ACCESS",ARTICLE,0,none,"PORTA, GF (REPRINT AUTHOR), MASSEY UNIV, SFS STAT, PRIVATE BAG 11222, PALMERSTON NORTH, NEW ZEALAND.;PORTA, GABRIELE FRIGERIO, XIAO, XUN, JONES, GEOFF, MASSEY UNIV, SFS STAT, PRIVATE BAG 11222, PALMERSTON NORTH, NEW ZEALAND.;BEBBINGTON, MARK, MASSEY UNIV, VOLCAN RISK SOLUT, PRIVATE BAG 11222, PALMERSTON NORTH, NEW ZEALAND.",10.1007/S10346-020-01388-5,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",,"RESILIENCE TO NATURES CHALLENGES NATIONAL SCIENCE CHALLENGE, NEW ZEALAND",,1612-510X,,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,,,ISI000523099300001,45,"ENGINEERING, GEOLOGY",3,"ENGINEERING, GEOLOGICAL, GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY",G.FRIGERIO.PORTAMASSEY.AC.NZ,,KZ2LQ,,"PORTA, GF (REPRINT AUTHOR), MASSEY UNIV, SFS STAT, PRIVATE BAG 11222, PALMERSTON NORTH, NEW ZEALAND",ISI,MASSEY UNIV;MASSEY UNIV,MASSEY UNIV,,"PORTA GF, NA, LANDSLIDES","PORTA GF, NA, LANDSLIDES",FALSE,2,0,0,0,0,0,4_11,0,5

This study devises a new method to measure resilience via recovery capability to validate indicators from social, economic, infrastructural, and environmental domains. The pollutant discharge data (waste-water and waste-gas discharge/emission data) of local power plants, sewage treatment plants and main factories were used to monitor recovery process of both people's living and local industrial production as the waste water/gas is released irregularly during the short disaster-hit period. A time series analysis of such data was employed to detect the disturbance on these infrastructures from disasters and to assess community recovery capability. A recent record-breaking flash flood in changzhou, a city in eastern-central china, was selected as a case study. We used ordinal logistic regression to identify leading proxies of flood resilience. A combination of six variables related to socioeconomic factors, infrastructure development and the environment, stood out and explained 61.4\% of the variance in measured recovery capability. These findings substantiate the possibility of using recovery measurement based on pollutant discharge to validate resilience metrics, and contribute more solid evidences for policy-makers and urban planners to make corresponding measures for resilience enhancement.",RECOVERY CAPABILITY; DISASTER RESILIENCE; RESILIENCE MEASUREMENT; POLLUTANT DISCHARGE DATA; EAST CHINA,COMMUNITY-RESILIENCE; DISASTER RESILIENCE; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; HURRICANE KATRINA; FRAMEWORK; HAZARDS; BASIN; INDICATORS; SYSTEMS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"AERTS JCJH, 2014, SCIENCE, V344, P472, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.1248222.;ALLEN D.

353,Breisinger C;Ecker O;Thiele R;Wiebelt M,Effects of the 2008 flood on economic performance and food security in yemen: a simulation analysis,DISASTERS,"Extreme weather events such as floods and droughts can have devastating consequences for individual well being and economic development, in particular in poor societies with limited availability of coping mechanisms. Combining a dynamic computable general equilibrium model of the yemeni economy with a household-level calorie consumption simulation model, this paper assesses the economy-wide, agricultural and food security effects of the 2008 tropical storm and flash flood that hit the hadramout and al-mahrah governorates. The estimation results suggest that agricultural value added, farm household incomes and rural food security deteriorated long term in the flood-affected areas. Due to economic spillover effects, significant income losses and increases in food insecurity also occurred in areas that were unaffected by flooding. This finding suggests that while most relief efforts are typically concentrated in directly affected areas, future efforts should also consider surrounding areas and indirectly affected people.",DYNAMIC COMPUTABLE GENERAL EQUILIBRIUM ANALYSIS; ECONOMY-WIDE EFFECTS; EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS; FLOODS; FOOD SECURITY; YEMEN,CLIMATE-CHANGE; ADAPTATION; DROUGHT; IMPACTS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,"AL-RIFFAI P, 2013, WOR BANK STUD, P31.;BLANKESPOOR B., 2010, 199 CTR GLOB DEV.;BOYD R, 2009, ENVIRON DEV ECON, V14, P371, DOI 10.1017/S1355770X08004956.;BREISINGER C., 2011, 1747 KIEL I WORLD EC.;BREISINGER C, 2012, SUSTAINABILITY-BASEL, V4, P2862, DOI 10.3390/SU4112862.;BREISINGER C, 2011, DEV POLICY REV, V29, P155, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-7679.2011.00530.X.;CENTRAL STATISTICAL ORGANISATION, 2006, HOUS BUDG SURV 2005.;CRED, 2014, EM DAT INT DIS DAT.;ECKER O., 2010, 982 IFPRI.;FAO (FOOD AND AGRICULTURE ORGANIZATION), 2011, FOOD PROD PROF DIV B, V16.;FAO WHO \& UNU, 2001, 1 FAO WHO UNU.;GOVERNMENT OF YEMEN THE WORLD BANK UN INTERNATIONAL STRATEGY FOR DISASTER REDUCTION AND INTERNATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE RED CRESCENT AND CROSS, 2009, DAM LOSS NEEDS ASS H.;HEADEY D, 2013, FOOD SECUR, V5, P327, DOI 10.1007/S12571-013-0253-0.;HORRIDGE M, 2005, J POLICY MODEL, V27, P285, DOI 10.1016/J.JPOLMOD.2005.01.008.;IPCC, 2012, MAN RISKS EXTR EV DI.;PAUW K, 2011, ENVIRON DEV ECON, V16, P177, DOI 10.1017/S1355770X10000471.;ROBINSON S, 2012, REV DEV ECON, V16, P489, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-9361.2012.00676.X.;SALINGER M, 2005, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V70, P1, DOI 10.1007/S10584-005-4243-X.;THURLOW J., 2004, 1 TRAD IND POL STRAT.;UNOCHA (UNITED NATIONS OFFICE FOR THE COORDINATION OF HUMANITARIAN AFFAIRS), 2008, YEM FLOODS SIT MAP 2.;WIEBELT M, 2013, FOOD POLICY, V43, P77, DOI 10.1016/J.FOODPOL.2013.08.009.;WMO, 2011, WEATH EXTR CHANG CLI.","WIEBELT, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), KIEL INST WORLD ECON, HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL 24105, GERMANY.;THIELE, RAINER, WIEBELT, MANFRED, KIEL INST WORLD ECON, HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL 24105, GERMANY.;BREISINGER, CLEMENS, ECKER, OLIVIER, INT FOOD POLICY RES INST, WASHINGTON, DC 20036 USA.",10.1111/DISA.12147,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,,,0361-3666,2,304-326,WILEY-BLACKWELL,40,2016,ISI000372286700007,22,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, SOCIAL SCIENCES - OTHER TOPICS",34,"ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, SOCIAL SCIENCES, INTERDISCIPLINARY",MANFRED.WIEBELTIFW-KIEL.DE,,DG7TN,,"WIEBELT, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), KIEL INST WORLD ECON, HINDENBURGUFER 66, KIEL 24105, GERMANY",ISI,KIEL INST WORLD ECON;INT FOOD POLICY RES INST,KIEL INST WORLD ECON,,"BREISINGER C, 2016, DISASTERS","BREISINGER C, 2016, DISASTERS",TRUE,0,2,0,0,0,2,4_11_16,2,1
8,Hooshyaripor F;Tahershamsi A,Effect of reservoir side slopes on dam-break flood waves,ENGINEERING APPLICATIONS OF COMPUTATIONAL FLUID MECHANICS,"Dam failure causes catastrophic flooding and immense damage downstream. There are many factors that affect the magnitude of such flash floods. In this study the influence of reservoir side slopes on dam-break hydrographs and water levels was investigated using experimental and numerical methods. Ideal trapezoidal reservoirs with different side angles varying from 30 degrees to 90 degrees were examined in the laboratory, while the reservoir capacity and breach cross section were considered to be the same. Due to the experimental limitations for measuring the flow parameters at any required points, 3d-numerical modeling was used. The results showed that the dam-break flood from the reservoir with a 30 degrees side slope has the highest peak-discharge, the sharpest rising and recession limbs of the hydrograph, and the earliest maximum water level and discharge. Based on the results, in view of risk assessment, the reservoirs with lower side slopes are expected to have more potential risk for damage in the event of dam break.",DAM BREAK; RESERVOIR SIDE SLOPE; EXPERIMENTAL METHOD; NUMERICAL SIMULATION; OUTFLOW HYDROGRAPH,PEARL-RIVER ESTUARY; NUMERICAL-MODEL; FLOWS; SPILLWAY; CHANNEL,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,"CHAU KW, 2004, INT J ENVIRON POLLUT, V21, P188, DOI 10.1504/IJEP.2004.004185.;CHAU KW, 2001, J HYDRAUL ENG-ASCE, V127, P72, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2001)127:1(72).;DARGAHI B, 2006, J HYDRAUL ENG-ASCE, V132, P899, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9429(2006)132:9(899).;FLUENT INC, 2006, FLUENT COMP SOFTW.;FLUENT INC, 2006, FLUENT 6 3 US MAN.;FLUENT INCORPORATED, 2006, GAMB COMP SOFTW.;GALLEGOS HA, 2009, ADV WATER RESOUR, V32, P1323, DOI 10.1016/J.ADVWATRES.2009.05.008.;HOOSHYARIPOR F, 2014, J HYDRO-ENVIRON RES, V8, P292, DOI 10.1016/J.JHER.2013.11.004.;KARKI KC, 1989, AIAA J, V27, P1167, DOI 10.2514/3.10242.;KHANKANDI AF, 2012, J HYDRAUL RES, V50, P376, DOI 10.1080/00221686.2012.690974.;LAROCQUE LA, 2013, J HYDRAUL ENG, V139, P569, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000705.;LAUBER G, 1998, J HYDRAUL RES, V36, P291, DOI 10.1080/00221689809498620.;LEAL JGAB, 2009, J HYDRAUL ENG, V135, P995, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000099.;LIANG D., 2012, DAM ENG, VXXIII, P41.;LIANG DF, 2007, J HYDROL, V332, P477, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2006.08.002.;LIU T, 2014, ENG APPL COMP FLUID, V8, P104, DOI 10.1080/19942060.2014.11015501.;MAGHSOODI R., 2012, DAM ENG, VXXIII, P53.;OZMEN-CAGATAY H, 2014, J HYDRO-ENVIRON RES, V8, P304, DOI 10.1016/J.JHER.2014.01.005.;PILOTTI M, 2010, J HYDRAUL ENG, V136, P693, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)HY.1943-7900.0000231.;PU JH, 2013, ENG APPL COMP FLUID, V7, P544.;RITTER A., 1982, Z VEREINES DTSCH ING, V36, P947.;SOARES-FRAZAO S, 2007, J HYDRAUL RES, V45, P27, DOI 10.1080/00221686.2007.9521830.;TAHER-SHAMSI A., 2003, DAM ENG, V14, P73.;VISCHER DL, 1998, DAM HYDRAULICS.","TAHERSHAMSI, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), AMIRKABIR UNIV TECHNOL, FAC CIVIL \& ENVIRONM ENGN, TEHRAN, IRAN.;HOOSHYARIPOR, FARHAD, TAHERSHAMSI, AHMAD, AMIRKABIR UNIV TECHNOL, FAC CIVIL \& ENVIRONM ENGN, TEHRAN, IRAN.",10.1080/19942060.2015.1039630,"HUNG HOM, KOWLOON, HONG KONG, 00000, PEOPLES R CHINA",,,,1994-2060,1,458-468,"HONG KONG POLYTECHNIC UNIV, DEPT CIVIL \& STRUCTURAL ENG",9,2015,ISI000371620400009,24,"ENGINEERING, MECHANICS",7,"ENGINEERING, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, ENGINEERING, MECHANICAL, MECHANICS",TSHAMSIAUT.AC.IR,,DF8PN,,"TAHERSHAMSI, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), AMIRKABIR UNIV TECHNOL, FAC CIVIL \& ENVIRONM ENGN, TEHRAN, IRAN",ISI,AMIRKABIR UNIV TECHNOL,AMIRKABIR UNIV TECHNOL,,"HOOSHYARIPOR F, 2015, ENG APPL COMP FLUID MECH","HOOSHYARIPOR F, 2015, ENG APPL COMP FLUID MECH",FALSE,1,0,1,0,0,0,4_12,0,3
276,Xia J;Teo Fy;Lin B;Falconer Ra,Formula of incipient velocity for flooded vehicles,NATURAL HAZARDS,"With the climate change caused by global warming, the occurrence probability of urban flooding due to flash floods has increased gradually. Flush floods propagate rapidly, which can lead to significant hazard to human life and property. Flood hazard to vehicles has become more noticeable and frequent in recent years. Therefore, it is important to investigate the behaviour of vehicles on flooded streets or roads. In the current study, a formula has been derived to predict the incipient velocity of flooded vehicles according to the mechanical condition of sliding equilibrium. A series of flume experiments were conducted using three types of scaled die-cast model vehicles, with two scales being tested for each type of vehicle. The experimental data obtained for the small-scale model vehicles were used to determine the two parameters in the derived formula, and the prediction accuracy of this formula was validated using the experimental data obtained for the large-scale model vehicles. Finally, the corresponding incipient velocities under various incoming depths were computed using this formula for these three prototype vehicles. It is found that for a specified vehicle, the value of incipient velocity reaches its minimum as the incoming flow depth approaches the height of the vehicle, and the smaller and lighter vehicle like mini cooper is the easiest to start sliding in floodwaters. The results can be used as a preliminary assessment to define the hazard to vehicles parking on flooded streets or roads.",URBAN FLOODING; FLOOD HAZARD; FLOODED VEHICLES; VEHICLE INSTABILITY; INCIPIENT VELOCITY; FLUME EXPERIMENTS,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,30,"BONHAM AJ, 1967, 100 U N S WAL WAT RE.;BRIGANDI G, 2007, GEOPH RES ABSTR, V9.;CHIEN N., 1999, MECH SEDIMENT TRANSP.;COX RJ, 2001, P C HYDR CIV ENG.;*ENV AG DEFRA, 2006, FLOOD RISKS PEOPL.","XIA, JQ (REPRINT AUTHOR), WUHAN UNIV, STATE KEY LAB WATER RESOURCES \& HYDROPOWER ENGN S, WUHAN 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA.;XIA, JUNQIANG, WUHAN UNIV, STATE KEY LAB WATER RESOURCES \& HYDROPOWER ENGN S, WUHAN 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA.;XIA, JUNQIANG, TEO, FANG YENN, LIN, BINLIANG, FALCONER, ROGER A., CARDIFF UNIV, SCH ENGN, HYDROENVIRONM RES CTR, CARDIFF CF24 3AA, S GLAM, WALES.",10.1007/S11069-010-9639-X,"233 SPRING ST, NEW YORK, NY 10013 USA",,"UK ENGINEERING AND PHYSICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCILENGINEERING \& PHYSICAL SCIENCES RESEARCH COUNCIL (EPSRC) [GR/S76304]; HALCROW CROUP LTD.; CHINESE MINISTRY OF EDUCATIONMINISTRY OF EDUCATION, CHINA [NCET-100619]; NATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINANATIONAL BASIC RESEARCH PROGRAM OF CHINA [2007CB714102/6]",,0921-030X,1,1-14,SPRINGER,58,2011,ISI000291696300001,18,"GEOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",19,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",XIAJQWHU.EDU.CN,,778IC,,"XIA, JQ (REPRINT AUTHOR), WUHAN UNIV, STATE KEY LAB WATER RESOURCES \& HYDROPOWER ENGN S, WUHAN 430072, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,WUHAN UNIV;CARDIFF UNIV,WUHAN UNIV,,"XIA J, 2011, NAT HAZARDS","XIA J, 2011, NAT HAZARDS",FALSE,1,7,0,0,0,0,4_12,1,1

Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the appropriate criteria of vehicle stability in floodwaters. Different forces acting on partially submerged vehicles have been analysed, with a mechanics-based formula of incipient velocity being derived. Experiments were conducted to obtain the conditions of water depth and corresponding velocity at the threshold of vehicle instability for three typical types of die-cast model vehicles. The data were used to determine two key parameters. Incipient velocities for partially submerged prototype vehicles in floodwaters were estimated using two different approaches, including the predictions using the scale ratios and computations based on the formula.

498,Zhou Q;Leng G;Su J;Ren Y,Comparison of urbanization and climate change impacts on urban flood volumes: importance of urban planning and drainage adaptation,SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT,"Understanding the drivers behind urban floods is critical for reducing its devastating impacts to human and society. This study investigates the impacts of recent urban development on hydrological runoff and urban flood volumes in a major city located in northern china, and compares the urbanization impacts with the effects induced by climate change under two representative concentration pathways (rcps 2.6 and 8.5).We then quantify the role of urban drainage system in mitigating flood volumes to inform future adaptation straiegies. A geospatial database on landuse types, surface imperviousness and drainage systems is developed and used as inputs into the swmm urban drainage model to estimate the flood volumes and related risks under various urbanization and climate change scenarios. It is found that urbanization has led to an increase in annual surface runoff by 208 to 413\%, but the changes in urban flood volumes can vary greatly depending on performance of drainage system along the development. Specifically, changes caused by urbanization in expected annual flood volumes are within a range of 194 to 942\%, which are much higher than the effects induced by climate change under the rcp 2.6 scenario (64 to 200\%). Through comparing the impacts of urbanization and climate change on urban runoff and flood volumes, this study highlights the importance for re-assessment of current and future urban drainage in coping with the changing urban floods induced by local and large-scale changes.

Nine water samples were analyzed for eight parameters, namely turbidity, total hardness, total dissolved solids, sulfates, chlorides, nitrates, total bacterial count, and total coliform groups. All of the samples showed different degrees of pollution, and most were unsuitable for drinking water as concentrations of various parameters exceeded recommended thresholds. Principal component analysis and factor analysis showed that two factors, the degree of mineralization and agricultural runoff, and flood entrainment, explained 82.50\% of the total variance.

Recent advances in transportation research provide an appropriate framework for simulating individual travelactivity patterns using an activity-based approach. These activity-based mobility models enable the prediction of the sequence of activities performed by individuals and locating them with a high spatial-temporal resolution. This paper describes the development of the mobrisk microsimulation system: a model for assessing the exposure of road users to extreme hydrometeorological events. Mobrisk aims at providing an accurate spatiotemporal exposure assessment by integrating travel-activity behaviors and mobility adaptation with respect to weather disruptions. The model is applied in a flash-flood-prone area in southern france to assess motorists' exposure to the september 2002 flash flood event. The results show that risk of flooding mainly occurs in principal road links with considerable traffic load. However, a lag time between the timing of the road submersion and persons crossing these roads contributes to reducing the potential vehicle-related fatal accidents. It is also found that sociodemographic variables have a significant effect on individual exposure. Thus, the proposed model demonstrates the benefits of considering spatiotemporal dynamics of population exposure to flash floods and presents an important improvement in exposure assessment methods. Such improved characterization of road user exposures can present valuable information for flood risk management services.",,GARD REGION; VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS; DISCREPANCY ANALYSIS; WEATHER CONDITIONS; SOUTHERN FRANCE; STATE SEQUENCES; SEPTEMBER 2002; UNITED-STATES; PRONE AREAS; IMPACT,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,4,"AL HASSAN Y, 1999, J TRANSP GEOGR, V7, P209, DOI DOI 10.1016/S0966-6923(98)00047-7.;ANDERSON MJ, 2001, AUSTRAL ECOL, V26, P32, DOI 10.1111/J.1442-9993.2001.01070.PP.X.;ANDREY J, 2013, J TRANSP GEOGR, V28, P192, DOI 10.1016/J.JTRANGEO.2012.08.014.;ANQUETIN S, 2010, J HYDROL, V394, P134, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2010.07.002.;ANTOINE J-M., 2001, ANN GEOGR, V110, P597.;ARENTZE T, 2000, ALBATROSS LEARNING B.;ASHLEY ST, 2008, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V47, P805, DOI 10.1175/2007JAMC1611.1.;AUBRECHT C, 2012, DISASTER ADV, V5, P48.;AULD JA, 2009, TRANSP LETT, V1, P243, DOI DOI 10.3328/TL.2009.01.03.245-255.;BALMER M, 2006, TRANSPORT RES REC, P125.;BECKX C, 2008, EPIDEMIOLOGY, V19, PS378.;BECKX C, 2009, ENVIRON IMPACT ASSES, V29, P179, DOI 10.1016/J.EIAR.2008.10.001.;BEKHOR S, 2006, ANN OPER RES, V144, P235, DOI 10.1007/S10479-006-0009-8.;BERDICA K., 2002, TRANSPORT POLICY, V9, P117, DOI DOI 10.1016/S0967-070X(02)00011-2.;BHAT CR, 2004, TRANSPORT RES REC, P57, DOI 10.3141/1894-07.;BOCKER L, 2013, TRANSPORT REV, V33, P71, DOI 10.1080/01441647.2012.747114.;BRANGER F, 2010, ENVIRON MODELL SOFTW, V25, P1672, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVSOFT.2010.06.005.;BRAUD I, 2010, J HYDROL, V394, P162, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2010.03.033.;CHAPIN F.S., 1974, HUMAN ACTIVITY PATTE.;CHUNG E, 2005, P 8 INT IEEE C INT T.;COOLS M, 2010, TRANSPORT RES REC, P22, DOI 10.3141/2157-03.;CUTTER SL, 2000, ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR, V90, P713, DOI 10.1111/0004-5608.00219.;DAWSON RJ, 2011, NAT HAZARDS, V59, P167, DOI 10.1007/S11069-011-9745-4.;DEBIONNE S, 2016, J HYDROL, V541, P636, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2016.01.064.;DELRIEU G, 2005, J HYDROMETEOROL, V6, P34, DOI 10.1175/JHM-400.1.;DIJKSTRA E.

151,Chen H;Liang Z;Liu Y;Liang Q;Xie S,Integrated remote sensing imagery and two-dimensional hydraulic modeling approach for impact evaluation of flood on crop yields,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The projected frequent occurrences of extreme flood events will cause significant losses to crops and will threaten food security. To reduce the potential risk and provide support for agricultural flood management, prevention, and mitigation, it is important to account for flood damage to crop production and to understand the relationship between flood.characteristics and crop losses. A quantitative and effective evaluation tool is therefore essential to explore what and how flood characteristics will affect the associated crop loss, based on accurately understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of flood evolution and crop growth. Current evaluation methods are generally integrally or qualitatively based on statistic data or ex-post survey with less diagnosis into the process and dynamics of historical flood events. Therefore, a quantitative and spatial evaluation framework is presented in this study that integrates remote sensing imagery and hydraulic model simulation to facilitate the identification of historical flood characteristics that influence crop losses. Remote sensing imagery can capture the spatial variation of crop yields and yield losses from floods on a grid scale over large areas, however, it is incapable of providing spatial information regarding flood progress. Two-dimensional hydraulic model can simulate the dynamics of surface runoff and accomplish spatial and temporal quantification of flood characteristics on a grid scale over watersheds, i.e., flow velocity and flood duration. The methodological framework developed herein includes the following: (a) vegetation indices for the critical period of crop growth from mid-high temporal and spatial remote sensing imagery in association with agricultural statistics data were used to develop empirical models to monitor the crop yield and evaluate yield losses from flood, (b) the two-dimensional hydraulic model coupled with the scs-cn hydrologic model was employed to simulate the flood evolution process, with the scs-cn model as a rainfall-runoff generator and the two-dimensional hydraulic model implementing the routing scheme for surface runoff, and (c) the spatial combination between crop yield losses and flood dynamics on a grid scale can be used to investigate the relationship between the intensity of flood characteristics and associated loss extent. The modeling framework was applied for a 50-year return period flood that occurred in jilin province, northeast china, which caused large agricultural losses in august 2013. The modeling results indicated that (a) the flow velocity was the most influential factor that caused spring corn, rice and soybean yield losses from extreme storm event in the mountainous regions, (b) the power function archived the best results that fit the velocity-loss relationship for mountainous areas, and (c) integrated remote sensing imagery and two-dimensional hydraulic modeling approach are helpful for evaluating the influence of historical flood event on crop production and investigating the relationship between flood characteristics and crop yield losses.

172,Kreibich H;Dimitrova B,Assessment of damages caused by different flood types,"FLOOD RECOVERY, INNOVATION AND RESPONSE II","Comprehensive risk assessments are essential to integrated, efficient flood management. However, investigations concentrate mainly on scenarios of slowly rising riverine floods and their loss assessment. The common loss models are focused on the water level as the primary factor determining damage, although, for example during flash floods, the velocity might be much more important. To improve the knowledge about flood losses and the loss-influencing factors, 1697 households affected by the elbe and danube flood in 2002 were interviewed. Cases affected by high groundwater levels, riverine floods, flash floods and dyke breaches were identified and separately analyzed. The four flood types show significantly different impact characteristics concerning the factors of water level, flood duration, flow velocity and contamination. In addition, the resulting losses differ significantly. Common loss models tested, i.e. Stage-damage curves, were as such not suitable to estimate losses due to dyke breaches and high groundwater levels. Therefore, new loss models should be developed for these special flood situations.",FLASH FLOODS; FLOOD LOSS; HIGH GROUNDWATER LEVELS; DYKE BREACHES; RIVERINE FLOODS; IMPACT; STAGE-DAMAGE CURVE,BUILDINGS,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,3,"AL-FUTAISI A, 1999, J WATER RES PL-ASCE, V125, P314, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)0733-9496(1999)125:6(314).;BUCK W., 1999, HY9815 U KARLSR I WA.;BUCHELE B, 2006, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V6, P485.;EFRON B, 1979, ANN STAT, V7, P1, DOI 10.1214/AOS/1176344552.;GANOULIS J., 2003, INT J RIVER BASIN MA, V1, P41, DOI [DOI 10.1080/15715124.2003.9635191, 10.1080/15715124.2003.9635191].;KELMAN I, 2004, ENG GEOL, V73, P297, DOI 10.1016/J.ENGGEO.2004.01.010.;KELMAN I, 2003, P I CIVIL ENG-MUNIC, V156, P207, DOI 10.1680/MUEN.2003.156.3.207.;KLEMES V, 1986, HYDROLOG SCI J, V31, P13, DOI 10.1080/02626668609491024.;KREIBICH H, 2005, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V5, P117, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-5-117-2005.;KREIBICH H, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P1679, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-1679-2009.;KREIBICH H, 2008, WATER RESOUR RES, V44, DOI 10.1029/2007WR006621.;MERZ B., 2004, OESTERREICHISCHE WASSER- UND ABFALLWIRTSCHAFT, V56, P27.;SCHWARZ J., 2005, BAUTECHNIK, V82, P845, DOI DOI 10.1002/BATE.200590247.;SMITH DI, 1994, WATER SA, V20, P231.;THICKEN A.H., 2005, WRR, V41.;THIEKEN A.

A simulation of the leh cloudburst disaster analysed the disaster itself, disaster risk reduction plans in the region, gaps in existing response mechanisms and reducing hazard impacts in the future. The participant group comprised academic researchers and industry experts in natural hazards, social vulnerability, engineering, historical and social sciences, education, journalism, disaster management and disaster risk reduction. Many of the participants had extensive local knowledge of ladakh or comparable neighbouring himalayan regions. Following the disaster, leh autonomous hill development council (lahdc), produced a district disaster management plan (ddmp), which addressed many of the gaps identified in the simulation. Most importantly, the document outlined a civil protection mechanism to respond to future hazardous events. This was utilised to assess future disaster response in the simulation scenario. From analysis of the scenario simulation, the role of the army was found to be key in minimizing the impact of the 2010 disaster, although in the future, the army may coordinate with the civil protection body as set out in the ddmp. Participants identified the lack of a local formalized civil protection plan as a major vulnerability, and the most vulnerable populations as the migrant communities. The group also discussed evidence of resilience among the population such as the role of monasteries and spirituality in psychological recovery and the impact of the initial local response. From broader discussion of the simulation scenario, it was possible to identify aspects of resilience for further study in a wider research project, such as identifying hazardous slopes from satellite mapping, informing the fieldwork program, designing social questionnaires to understand risk perception and formulating questions to guide focus-group discussions on community resilience.",SCENARIO; EMERGENCY RESPONSE; EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT; RESILIENCE; VULNERABILITY; CAPACITY,FLASH FLOODS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,none,"MUELLER, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), UCL, INST RISK \& DISASTER REDUCT, LONDON, ENGLAND.;MUELLER, SONJA, SAMMONDS, PETER, UCL, INST RISK \& DISASTER REDUCT, LONDON, ENGLAND.;BHAT, GHULAM M., PANDITA, SUNDEEP, SURI, KAVITA, THUSU, BINDRA, UNIV JAMMU, JAMMU, JAMMU \& KASHMIR, INDIA.;THUSU, BINDRA, UCL, DEPT GEOL, LONDON, ENGLAND.;LE MASSON, VIRGINIE, OVERSEAS DEV INST, LONDON, ENGLAND.",10.1016/J.IJDRR.2018.09.004,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,"UK RESEARCH COUNCILS GLOBAL CHALLENGES RESEARCH FUND [538570, 173143]",,2212-4209,,485-494,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,33,2019,ISI000454523300041,19,"GEOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",18,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",SONJA.MUELLER.14UCL.AC.UK,,HF8WQ,,"MUELLER, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), UCL, INST RISK \& DISASTER REDUCT, LONDON, ENGLAND",ISI,INST RISK AND DISASTER REDUCT;UNIV JAMMU;OVERSEAS DEV INST,INST RISK AND DISASTER REDUCT,,"MUELLER S, 2019, INT J DISASTER RISK REDUCT","MUELLER S, 2019, INT J DISASTER RISK REDUCT",TRUE,0,0,0,0,0,1_2_4_6,4_6_16,1,2

To supply this objective, numerical social networks (nsn) and smartphone applications could positively complete the official institutional system, especially by means of the dynamic nature of shared contents, and with the social interactions they support. Nonetheless, even if several countries (united states or philippines for example) already use these systems to warn the population in case of future floods, and even if the french government launched a specific app the 2016 june 8th (namely saip), the french citizens and stakeholders do not always use them during the alert process. This is generally explained by the french protection system on individual data, the lack of validation over information shared by citizens in real time and by the technical locks the official services have to remove. Then this paper aims to address the benefits and limits from the use of nsn and smartphones during flood warnings in france, and it also seeks to identify the place of such systems to perform their utility in short term.",SOCIAL NETWORK; FLOOD HAZARD; WARNING SYSTEM,VOLUNTEERED GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION; ADDICTION; PERCEPTION; INTERNET; RISK,FRENCH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"ACAR ADAM, 2011, INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF WEB BASED COMMUNITIES, V7, P392, DOI 10.1504/IJWBC.2011.041206.;AUTORITE DE REGULATION DES COMMUNICATIONS ELECTRONIQUES ET DES POSTES (ARCEP), 2015, OBL DEPL 4G LTE.;BIRD D, 2012, AUST J EMERG MANAG, V27, P27.;BOUDOU M., 2015, THESIS.;BROWNLEE B., 2011, MOBILE AD HOC NETWOR.;CAVALIERE C., 2016, ACT C SAGEO NIC.;CENTRE D'ETUDES ET D'EXPERTISE SUR LES RISQUES L'ENVIRONNEMENT LA MOBILITE ET L'AMENAGEMENT (CEREMA), 2014, RET EXP INT DEP VAR.;CHAK K, 2004, CYBERPSYCHOL BEHAV, V7, P559, DOI 10.1089/1094931042403073.;CHATEAURAYNAUD F., 2006, ETRE VIGILANT OPERAT, P8.;COLEMAN DJ, 2009, INT J SPAT DATA INFR, V4, P332, DOI 10.2902/1725-0463.2009.04.ART16.;COMMISSION NATIONALE DE L'INFORMATIQUE ET DES LIBERTES (CNIL), 2011, RAPP ACT 2011.;CORVEY J.

Nonetheless, learning from these effects after such disasters that lead to improved preparedness and community resilience is limited. This paper analyzes the magisterial community building resilience to flash floods. Based on liao theoretical approach about the key properties of resilience, a survey was carried out based on household questionnaires and expert interviews in the selected study area. The analysis of building resilience community allowed the identification of strategies used to cope with flash floods and identify the aspects that have favored or inhibited the construction of resilience. In order to cope with flash floods, the community has promoted strategies independent of those carried out by the local government, but these do not have a significant contribution to resilience. Based on the results, it is established that the magisterial community, although organized on its own initiative and having made adjustments through the implementation of strategies to cope with flash floods, is not a resilient community. However, fundamental aspects for the construction of resilience have been developed. A radical change in mexico's flood risk management paradigm is required to promote resilience at all governance and decision-making levels.",COMMUNITY RESILIENCE; DISASTER RISK REDUCTION; FLASH FLOODS; CIUDAD VALLES-SLP,VULNERABILITY; ADAPTATION,ENGLISH,"ARTICLE, BOOK CHAPTER",INCOLLECTION,0,"AGENDA AMBIENTAL, 2009, ATL RIESG CIUD VALL.;ARAGON-DURAND F, 2015, REPORTE MEXICANO CAM, P29.;BECK M, 2012, ENV DISASTER LINKAGE, P140.;BIRKMAN J, 2006, MEASURING VULNERABIL, P524.;BRUIJN K.

Data were collected in the basin through in-depth expert interviews, site visits, and household surveys, and were triangulated with climate change data from the available literature. Basin inhabitants cooperate on extreme events that are exacerbated by climate change, including water scarcity, droughts, and flash floods. Water demand and efficiency are key issues driven by population growth, expansion of croplands, and deteriorating canal infrastructure. Lessons learned can be considered in other small transboundary tributaries in the ferghana valley and central asia, which demonstrate how, despite the international level of tension on water issues in the region, local communities can find solutions.

Insights from the northeastern floodplains of bangladesh,ECOLOGICAL ECONOMICS,"This paper offers a novel methodological approach for better understanding how different capital assets can be organized, transformed, and used in different combinations to reduce livelihood sensitivity to climatic stresses - an area that requires greater research attention in the context of adaptation policy. Research was conducted in the northeastern floodplain communities of bangladesh, regarded as one of the most climate sensitive, resource poor, and highly understudied areas of the country. This wetland-dominated ecosystem is home to diverse resources user groups (e.g., farmer and fisher) who are subjected to regular seasonal flooding, excessive rainfall, drought, and flash floods. Working in 12 adjacent villages of two significant wetlands (hakaluki haor and tanguar haor), qualitative and quantitative data were collected through 15 focus groups (n=15), 35 key informant interviews, and 356 household surveys to better understand how community members adapt in response to their livelihood sensitivity to the climatic stresses.

245,Durand S,From the risk culture to the local cultures of risk. An ethnographic investigation of living with a constant flood risk in the south east of france,3RD EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT (FLOODRISK 2016),"In france, flooding is the leading cause of mortality due to natural disasters and cause very significant economic damage. The question of risk forgetting has been identified as one of the key issues to reduce these negative consequences of flooding. There is need to study this oversight of risk on a long term basis, long after the event takes place and when routines are re-established. This is the challenge faced by the ethnographic dissertation summarized in this article: understanding the mechanisms of risk forgetting by investigating how the issue of flooding occurs in everyday life. The dissertation questions what circulates about flooding between inhabitants and how they organize their practices in relation to the risk. The field of study is a french suburban city which was built on wetlands and remains vulnerable to flash floods. This case study provides insight into the collective mechanisms from invisible danger implementation. The increased visibility of the protection made by local policies and the comforting effect of normative sharing provided a normalization of the trust in the protection. Through the interactions, statements are continually developed in the interests of their acceptability: statements of relativism circulate more than the ones that open on the horizon of danger. Moreover, the current development of a logic of safety for social risks reduction contradicts the prevention of flooding. Above all, neither the links between inhabitants nor the links with their living environment provide a sufficient collective development base for a risk culture deployment.",,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,"BLANCHEMANCHE P., 2000, LATTARA, P178.;CHABAL J, 2005, POLITIX, V2, P169.;DAVIS M., 1999, ECOLOGY FEAR.;DURAND S., 2015, ANN RECHERCHE URBAIN, V110, P174.;DURAND S., 2014, THESIS.;FRANCK L., 1982, RIVIERE NOMMEE LEZ.;GUSFIELD J.

194,Bwambale B;Muhumuza M;Nyeko M,Traditional ecological knowledge and flood risk management: a preliminary case study of the rwenzori,JAMBA-JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK STUDIES,"The shift from flood protection to flood risk management, together with recent arguments on incorporating culture in managing risk, underscores the application of traditional ecological knowledge (tek) in managing disasters from flood hazards. Yet, documentation and incorporation of tek into practice remains a challenge. This article contributes to addressing this challenge by exploring the existence of tek to flooding in the rwenzori mountains, uganda. Using semi-structured interviews, data were collected from residents of the nyamwamba watershed where intense flash floods caused deadly impacts in may 2013. Collected data were analysed using content, thematic and interpretive analysis techniques. Results indicate that tek is exhibited through various traditional ecological approaches (teas). Although endangered, teas (conducted through collective action for a communally accepted end) are framed in three main activities: (1) assessment and prediction of rainfall and flood by the traditional hydro-meteorologist (diviner) and the traditional rain forecaster (rainmaker), (2) the mountain cleansing ritual (which act as flood risk awareness platform), and (3) immunising riverine communities through planting certain indigenous plants, which improve hydrological systems through their high conservation value for native ecological diversity. As most teas are conducted through collective action, they represent a platform to understand local capacities and enhance adoption of measures, and/or a source of knowledge for new measures to address flood risk. Therefore, full-scale investigations of these teas, determining how relevant teas are fine-tuned, and (scientific) measures enculturated based on fine-tuned teas could result in effective flood risk management in various flood hotspots where teas influence action.",,DISASTER MANAGEMENT; RESILIENCE; COMMUNITY; ADAPTATION; MOUNTAINS; GIS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"ABAM TKS, 1993, HYDROLOG SCI J, V38, P231, DOI 10.1080/02626669309492665.;[ANONYMOUS], 2016, NAT POP HOUS CENS 20.;ARMS K, 2004, ENV SCI.;BARBEDO J, 2014, ECOL SOC, V19, DOI 10.5751/ES-06482-190254.;BERGOGLIO J, 2015, LAUDATO SI CARE OUR.;BERNARD H.

The emergency management on the highest - national - level is thoroughly described in the national emergency plan while the factors such as education, culture, communication, and volunteerism influencing to a significant extent the ``municipality level are not managed and are organized ad hoc. On this lowest level, the representatives do not usually have the required managing skills and knowledge (they receive some education in this area but quite often they have no practical experience with large-scale leadership) which appears as problematic since they have to lead and coordinate numerous groups of citizens and volunteers. In this article the authors, via personal interviews with the municipality representatives, evaluate the critical factors of successful crises mitigation based on the experience of small towns with the emergency management implemented during the flash floods 2010 in the liberec region.

It poses serious threats to the concept of sustainable development. Over the last two decades, more than 1.3 million people and nearly two trillion dollars have been lost due to natural disasters. The paper discusses the status of disaster mitigation information systems during the uttarakhand disaster of june 2013. The researchers have discussed the status of such actions taken by both government and non-government organizations (ngos) from a qualitative perspective. The software package for social science (spss) software was used for the analysis and the results are presented in descriptive statistical format. As many as (n=1500) respondents were interviewed, out of which 80\% respondents were ill-informed. Over 80\% respondents were found to be untrained to respond in a disastrous situation. Hence, the researchers have proposed the use of better information and communication mediums with the assistance of public and private partnership (ppp model) to deal with disastrous situations in the future along with some indigenous methods.",COMMUNITY INFORMATION; DISASTER TRAINING AND PREPARATION; DISASTER MITIGATION; PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP; INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION; UTTARAKHAND FLASH FLOOD 2013,KOTI-BANAL ARCHITECTURE; RECOVERY; LESSONS; REGION; INDIA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,none,"KHAN, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), INDIAN INST MANAGEMENT KASHIPUR, CTR EXCELLENCE PUBL POLICY \& GOVT, KASHIPUR 244713, INDIA.;KHAN, ASIF, ISLAM, K.

To help understand and improve extreme weather risk communication and management, this study uses a mental models research approach to investigate the flash flood warning system and its risk decision context. Data were collected in the boulder, colorado area from mental models interviews with forecasters, public officials, and media broadcasters, who each make important interacting decisions in the warning system, and from a group modeling session with forecasters. Analysis of the data informed development of a decision-focused model of the flash flood warning system that integrates the professionals' perspectives. Comparative analysis of individual and group data with this model characterizes how these professionals conceptualize flash flood risks and associated uncertainty, create and disseminate flash flood warning information, and perceive how warning information is ( and should be) used in their own and others' decisions. The analysis indicates that warning system functioning would benefit from professionals developing a clearer, shared understanding of flash flood risks and the warning system, across their areas of expertise and job roles. Given the challenges in risk communication and decision making for complex, rapidly evolving hazards such as flash floods, another priority is development of improved warning content to help members of the public protect themselves when needed. Also important is professional communication with members of the public about allocation of responsibilities for managing flash flood risks, as well as improved system-wide management of uncertainty in decisions.",EXPERTISE; FLASH FLOODING; MENTAL MODELS; RISK COMMUNICATION; WARNING,MITIGATION BEHAVIOR; UNITED-STATES; FORT-COLLINS; COMMUNICATION; PREPAREDNESS; PERCEPTIONS; PEOPLE; MANAGEMENT; RESIDENTS; DISASTER,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,25,"AGUILAR J, 2013, DAILY CAMERA.;AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY GLOSSARY OF METEOROLOGY, 2000, FLASH FLOOD.;ASHLEY ST, 2008, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V47, P805, DOI 10.1175/2007JAMC1611.1.;BORGA M, 2011, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V14, P834, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2011.05.017.;BORGA M, 2009, HYDROLOGICAL PROCESS, V22, P3883.;BOSTROM A, 1994, RISK ANAL, V14, P959, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.1994.TB00065.X.;BOSTROM A, 1992, J SOC ISSUES, V48, P85, DOI 10.1111/J.1540-4560.1992.TB01946.X.;BOSTROM A, WEATHER CLIMAT UNPUB.;BOULDER OFFICE OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, 2012, MOUNT COMM PREP GUID.;BROTZGE J, 2013, B AM METEOROL SOC, V94, P1715, DOI 10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00147.1.;BUBECK P, 2012, RISK ANAL, V32, P1481, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.2011.01783.X.;CASMAN E, 2000, RISK ANAL, V20, P493.;CITY OF BOULDER, 2012, FLASH FLOOD SAFETY.;DE BRUIN WB, 2013, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V110, P14062, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.1212729110.;DEKAY ML, 1993, RISK ANAL, V13, P193, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.1993.TB01069.X.;DEMUTH JL, 2012, B AM METEOROL SOC, V93, P1133, DOI 10.1175/BAMS-D-11-00150.1.;DROBOT S.

420,Durand S,Investigating ``risk culture. Ethnography of a wealthy neighborhood in a threatened area,HOUILLE BLANCHE-REVUE INTERNATIONALE DE L EAU,"Risk management policies promote prevention and call for risk culture programmes in hazardous areas in order to fight against the phenomenon of risk oblivion that one can notice after a disaster. My university thesis summarized in this article - questioned this possibility by investigating how we live, in everyday life, in flood-prone areas. Through an ethnographic piece of work, in particular a ``discreet resident observation, the thesis seeks to identify what the inhabitants exchange about floods and how they organize their practices in relation to the risk. The field study, lattes, is an upper middle-class suburban neighborhood located in the south east of france (mediterranean coast). This city was built on wetlands and remains vulnerable to flash floods. This case study allows us to grasp the collective mechanisms at stake in the construction of the invisibility of a danger. The high visibility of the protection made by local policies and the comforting effect of normative sharing provided a normalization of people's trust in the protection. Through interactions, statements are built to be acceptable.

485,Lindell Mk;Arlikatti S;Huang Sk,"Immediate behavioral response to the june 17, 2013 flash floods in uttarakhand, north india",INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,"The 2013 uttarakhand flash flood was such a surprise for those at risk that the predominant source of information for their risk was environmental cues and, secondarily, peer warnings rather than official warnings. Of those who received warnings, few received information other than the identity of the flood threat. A survey of 316 survivors found that most people's first response was to immediately evacuate but some stayed to receive additional information, confirm their warnings, or engage in evacuation preparations. Unfortunately, engaging in these milling behaviors necessarily delayed their final evacuations. Mediation analysis revealed that psychological reactions mediated the relationship between information sources and behavioral responses. Further analyses revealed that immediate evacuation and evacuation delay were both predicted best by information search and positive affect, but correlation analyses indicated that a number of other models were also plausible. Final evacuation was best predicted by immediate evacuation and, to a significantly lesser extent, household together. Overall, results suggest that the protective action decision model (padm) should be considered a useful framework for examining household responses to flash floods in developing countries like india. It supports the conclusion that a household's first warning source is a function of two distinct detection and dissemination systems within a community-an official system and an informal system. However, it fails to capture what pre-impact emergency preparedness entails for rapid onset events in a developing country context. Further research is needed to determine the relative importance of situational and cultural characteristics in producing these observed differences.",FLASH FLOOD; WARNING; EVACUATION; PSYCHOLOGICAL REACTIONS; INDIA,RISK PERCEPTION; MENTAL MODELS; WARNINGS; EVACUATION; DISASTER; TSUNAMI; COMMUNICATION; EARTHQUAKE; BELIEFS; HAZARD,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,7,none,"LINDELL, MK (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV WASHINGTON, DEPT URBAN DESIGN \& PLANNING, BOX 355740, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA.;LINDELL, MICHAEL K., UNIV WASHINGTON, DEPT URBAN DESIGN \& PLANNING, BOX 355740, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA.;ARLIKATTI, SUDHA, RABDAN ACAD, BUSINESS CONTINU MANAGEMENT \& INTEGRATED EMERGENC, FAC RESILIENCE, ABU DHABI, U ARAB EMIRATES.;HUANG, SHIH-KAI, JACKSONVILLE STATE UNIV, DEPT EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, JACKSONVILLE, AL 36265 USA.",10.1016/J.IJDRR.2018.11.011,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATIONNATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (NSF) [IMEE-11361323, CMMI-1760766]",,2212-4209,,129-146,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,34,2019,ISI000460032200013,96,"GEOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",13,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",MLINDELLUW.EDU SARLIKATTIRA.AC.AE SHUANGJSU.EDU,,HN2RJ,,"LINDELL, MK (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV WASHINGTON, DEPT URBAN DESIGN \& PLANNING, BOX 355740, SEATTLE, WA 98195 USA",ISI,UNIV WASHINGTON;RABDAN ACAD;JACKSONVILLE STATE UNIV,UNIV WASHINGTON,,"LINDELL MK, 2019, INT J DISASTER RISK REDUCT","LINDELL MK, 2019, INT J DISASTER RISK REDUCT",TRUE,0,0,0,0,3,0,5_6_11_16,0,1

305,Sipe N;Vella K,Relocating a flood-affected community: good planning or good politics?,JOURNAL OF THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION,"Problem, research strategy and findings: on january 10, 2011, the town of grantham, queensland (australia), was inundated with a flash flood in which 12 of the town's 370 residents drowned. The overall damage bill in queensland was aud there exists 2.38 billion (usd there exists 2.4 billion) with 35 deaths, and more than three-quarters of the state was declared a flood disaster zone. In this study, we focus on the unusual and even rare decision to relocate grantham in march 2011. The lockyer valley regional council (lvrc) acquired a 377-hectare (932-acre) site to enable a voluntary swap of equivalent-sized lots. In addition, planning regulations were set aside to streamline the relocation of a portion of the town. We review the natural hazard literature as it relates to community relocation, state and local government documents related to grantham, and reports and newspaper articles related to the flood. We also analyze data from interviews with key stakeholders. We document the process of community relocation, assess the relocation process in grantham against best practice, examine whether the process of community relocation can be upscaled and if the grantham relocation is an example of good planning or good politics. Takeaway for practice: our study reveals two key messages for practice. Community relocation (albeit a small one) is possible, and the process can be done quickly, some grantham residents moved into their new, relocated homes in december 2012, just 11 months after the flood. Moreover, the role of existing planning regulations can be a hindrance to quick action, political leadership, particularly at the local level, is key to implementing the relocation.",GRANTHAM (AUSTRALIA); FLOODS; RELOCATION; DISASTER RECOVERY; RECONSTRUCTION,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,8,"ABEL N, 2011, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V14, P279, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2010.12.002.;ADGER WN, 2013, NAT CLIM CHANGE, V3, P112, DOI [10.1038/NCLIMATE1666, 10.1038/NCLIMATE1666].;BRONEN R, 2013, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V110, P9320, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.1210508110.;COATES L, 2012, MOVING GRANTHAM RELO.;DAVID E, 1984, J AM PLANN ASSOC, V50, P22, DOI 10.1080/01944368408976579.;FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY \& THE AMERICAN PLANNING ASSOCIATION, 2005, POL GUID PLANN POSTD.;IMURA M., 2009, ASIAN J ENV DISASTER, V1, P199, DOI 10.3850/S1793924009000029.;INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION, 2002, HDB PREP RES ACT PLA.;LOCKYER VALLEY REGIONAL COUNCIL, 2011, LOCK VALL GRATH MAST.;NILSSON B, 2010, EUR URBAN REG STUD, V17, P433, DOI 10.1177/0969776410369045.;NIVEN RJ, 2013, REG ENVIRON CHANGE, V13, P193, DOI 10.1007/S10113-012-0315-4.;OLIVERSMITH A, 1991, DISASTERS, V15, P12, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-7717.1991.TB00423.X.;PERRY R.

Further, there is growing recognization in disaster science to develop framework to build resilience of the communities prone to natural hazards as highlighted by sendai framework for drr 2015-2030. Again, community resilience especially early warning solution for flash floods, debris flow and land-slides in mountainous region of afghanistan has escaped investigation and analysis. The objective of this paper is to explore the framework of existing monitoring/early warning systems (ews) for landslides, mudslides and flood in selected villages/districts of district badakhshan province. The framework is based on household questionnaire survey among 144respondents selected through purposive sampling method. The climate-related disaster community resilience framework (cdcrf) revealed that there diminishing resilience culture among the communities in conflict prone area of badakhshan mountain. However, despite their exposure to the climate induced extreme events, the community has not been able to develop their coping capacity. It has also been observer that the primary reason for diminishing resilience culture among communities, lack of public accesses to science based information, degradation of indigenous knowledge on hazard, gendered livelihood transformation and limited adaptive capacity.

In order to effectively prevent and control them, the government initiated the project of building up a comprehensive nonstructural measure system in 103 pilot counties from 2009. Based on the pilot experience, this project involved 2058 counties of 29 provinces and xinjiang production and construction corp from 2013. Analysis and evaluation of flash flood disaster is an important element task of this project. According to analyze the characteristics of rainstorm, basic parameters of the small watershed, social economy, the historical flood, etc. In the mountain areas possibly occur flash flood, this task aims to assess the flood control capacity of villages, towns and cities along the mountain rivers, declare the distribution of population and housings in the areas with different hazard grades, estimate the early-warning indexes such as rainfall and water level and their threshold values. The results can support and guide the warning system, forecasting, regional planning, land use and emergency response, and so on for flash flood disaster prevention. This paper will use a case of two small watersheds in lingbao county of henan province to introduce the conceptual framework, methodology, process, key technology, rationality analysis and results of analysis and evaluation on flash flood disaster.

While evacuation remains the dominant strategy for a range of hazards, a review of the literature suggests growing awareness of the dangers associated with late evacuations and some limited consideration of shelter-in-place options. This study examines the feasibility of a shelter-in-place strategy for flash floods in australia through: a review of literatures on evacuation, `sheltering-in-place' and flood fatalities, an analysis of australian flash flood fatalities and injuries, and interviews with flood and emergency managers. The results demonstrate that the majority of flash flood fatalities (75.7 per cent) have occurred outside when people have entered flood waters in a vehicle or on foot for a range of reasons, including to continue their intended travel, engage in recreational pursuits, continue their work, and evacuate or carry out a rescue. Interviews with emergency managers confirm that while shelter-in-place may not be the preferred option, the strategy may need to be implemented for flash floods when, due to the limited warning times, evacuation is not possible.",FLASH FLOODS; FLOOD FATALITIES; FLOOD SAFETY; SHELTER-IN-PLACE,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,28,"AFAC, 2005, POS PAP BUSHF COMM S.;ASHLEY ST, 2008, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V47, P805, DOI 10.1175/2007JAMC1611.1.;BAKER E.

Over the past decades, researchers have used various socio-cognitive models or threat and coping mechanisms to explain individual protective behaviours. However, these models ignore the fact that people are not equally ready to act upon a danger, and they (the models) give limited insights into the effectiveness of communication strategies to foster risk reduction behaviours. Therefore, we explored the current state of homeowners' readiness to undertake risk reduction behaviours in flood risk areas by applying a dynamic protection motivation framework. We conducted a survey in an italian municipality that experienced severe flash flooding in september 2018. The results show that people are motivated by different factors in prompting risk reduction behaviour based on their chosen types of protective measures. For example, people that undertook structural or avoidance measures are more likely to be motivated to protect themselves by increased perceptions of vulnerability and response efficacy and are less worried about expected flood losses compared to people that undertook only basic emergency measures. In this paper, we argue how these new insights contribute to targeting flood risk communication strategies to groups of individuals characterized by different readiness stages and motivations to protect themselves.",,MITIGATION BEHAVIOR; SOCIAL PERCEPTIONS; MANAGEMENT; PEOPLE; HOUSEHOLDS; DISASTER; COMMUNICATION; PREPAREDNESS; RESIDENTS; PRONE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"WEYRICH, P (REPRINT AUTHOR), SWISS FED INST TECHNOL, DEPT ENVIRONM SYST SCI, CLIMATE POLICY GRP, CH-8092 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.;WEYRICH, PHILIPPE, PATT, ANTHONY, SWISS FED INST TECHNOL, DEPT ENVIRONM SYST SCI, CLIMATE POLICY GRP, CH-8092 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND.;MONDINO, ELENA, DI BALDASSARRE, GIULIANO, UPPSALA UNIV, DEPT EARTH SCI, S-75236 UPPSALA, SWEDEN.;MONDINO, ELENA, DI BALDASSARRE, GIULIANO, CTR NAT HAZARDS \& DISASTER SCI, UPPSALA, SWEDEN.;BORGA, MARCO, UNIV PADUA, DEPT LAND ENVIRONM AGR \& FORESTRY, I-35122 PADUA, ITALY.;SCOLOBIG, ANNA, UNIV GENEVA, ENVIRONM GOVERNANCE \& TERR DEV HUB INST, CH-1205 GENEVA, SWITZERLAND.",10.5194/NHESS-20-287-2020,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",,,,1561-8633,1,287-298,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,20,2020,ISI000509388300001,53,"GEOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",6,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",PHILIPPE.WEYRICHUSYS.ETHZ.CH,,KF6ZA,,"WEYRICH, P (REPRINT AUTHOR), SWISS FED INST TECHNOL, DEPT ENVIRONM SYST SCI, CLIMATE POLICY GRP, CH-8092 ZURICH, SWITZERLAND",ISI,SWISS FED INST TECHNOL;UPPSALA UNIV;CTR NAT HAZARDS AND DISASTER SCI;UNIV PADUA;UNIV GENEVA,SWISS FED INST TECHNOL,,"WEYRICH P, 2020, NAT HAZARDS EARTH SYST SCI","WEYRICH P, 2020, NAT HAZARDS EARTH SYST SCI",TRUE,0,0,3,0,0,0,6_11,2,1

Thirty-eight qualitative interviews, two telephone surveys with 600 respondents, and two onsite interviews (74/95 respondents) were conducted. Mental models concerning flash floods are much better developed than those for landslides because the key physical processes for flash floods are easier for the general public to recognize and understand. Mental models are influenced by the local conditions. People who have a better knowledge about the hazards are those who use many different sources to inform themselves, express fear about natural hazards, or have previous experience with hazards.

42,Poussin Jk;Botzen Wjw;Aerts Jcjh,Effectiveness of flood damage mitigation measures: empirical evidence from french flood disasters,GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS,"Recent destructive flood events and projected increases in flood risks as a result of climate change in many regions around the world demonstrate the importance of improving flood risk management. Flood-proofing of buildings is often advocated as an effective strategy for limiting damage caused by floods. However, few empirical studies have estimated the damage that can be avoided by implementing such flood damage mitigation measures. This study estimates potential damage savings and the cost-effectiveness of specific flood damage mitigation measures that were implemented by households during major flood events in france. For this purpose, data about flood damage experienced and household flood preparedness were collected using a survey of 885 french households in three flood-prone regions that face different flood hazards. Four main conclusions can be drawn from this study. First, using regression analysis results in improved estimates of the effectiveness of mitigation measures than methods used by earlier studies that compare mean damage suffered between households who have, and who have not, taken these measures. Second, this study has provided empirical insights showing that some mitigation measures can substantially reduce damage during floods. Third, the effectiveness of the mitigation measures is very regional dependent, which can be explained by the different characteristics of the flood hazard in our sample areas that experience either slow onset river flooding or more rapid flash and coastal flooding. Fourth, the cost-efficiency of the flood damage mitigation measures depends strongly on the flood probability faced by households. (C) 2014 elsevier ltd.

Current approaches in vulnerability research are driven by a divide between social scientists who tend to view vulnerability as representing a set of socio-economic factors, and scientists who view vulnerability in terms of the degree of loss to an element at risk. To close this gap, a multi-dimensional vulnerability analysis has been undertaken focusing on flash flood hazards in greece. To represent physical vulnerability, an empirical relation between the process intensity and the degree of loss was established. With respect to social vulnerability, an assessment was undertaken by means of empirical data collection based on a door-to-door survey. In general, both physical and social vulnerability was comparable low, which is interpreted as a result from (a) specific building regulations in greece as well as general design principles leading to less structural susceptibility of elements at risk exposed, and (b) a relatively low economic loss leading to less social vulnerability of citizens exposed. It is shown that a combination of different perspectives of vulnerability will lead to a better understanding of perceptions of actors regarding their vulnerabilities and capacities.",PHYSICAL VULNERABILITY; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; RISK ASSESSMENT; FLASH FLOOD; EAST ATTICA; GREECE,SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; HAZARDS; SUSCEPTIBILITY; EUROPE,ENGLISH,"ARTICLE, PROCEEDINGS PAPER",ARTICLE,20,"ALEXAKIS D, 2011, ENVIRON EARTH SCI, V63, P1369, DOI 10.1007/S12665-010-0807-9.;APEL H, 2009, NAT HAZARDS, V49, P79, DOI 10.1007/S11069-008-9277-8.;BARREDO JI, 2007, NAT HAZARDS, V42, P125, DOI 10.1007/S11069-006-9065-2.;BATZING W, 2002, AKTUELLEN VERANDERUN.;BIRKHOLZ S, 2014, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V478, P12, DOI 10.1016/J.SCITOTENV.2014.01.061.;BIRKMANN J, 2013, NAT HAZARDS, V67, P193, DOI 10.1007/S11069-013-0558-5.;BIRKMANN J., 2006, MEASURING VULNERABIL, V1, P9, DOI DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6975.;BORGA M, 2011, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V14, P834, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2011.05.017.;BORGA M, 2010, J HYDROL, V394, P1, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2010.07.048.;BURNINGHAM K, 2008, DISASTERS, V32, P216, DOI 10.1111/J.0361-3666.2007.01036.X.;CALIANNO M, 2013, J HYDROL, V477, P1, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2012.09.036.;CHAMBERS R, 1989, IDS BULL-I DEV STUD, V20, P1, DOI 10.1111/J.1759-5436.1989.MP20002001.X.;CREUTIN JD, 2003, HYDROL PROCESS, V17, P1453, DOI 10.1002/HYP.5122.;CUTTER SL, 2003, SOC SCI QUART, V84, P242, DOI 10.1111/1540-6237.8402002.;DE MARCHI B, 2007, RES REPORT.;DIAKAKIS M, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V62, P485, DOI 10.1007/S11069-012-0090-Z.;FEKETE A, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P393, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-393-2009.;FEKETE A, 2010, GRADUATE SERIES UN U, V4.;FELL R, 2008, ENG GEOL, V102, P85, DOI 10.1016/J.ENGGEO.2008.03.022.;FELSENSTEIN D, 2014, NAT HAZARDS, V71, P463, DOI 10.1007/S11069-013-0929-Y.;FIELD CB, 2012, SPECIAL REPORT OF TH.;FUCHS S, 2007, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V7, P495, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-7-495-2007.;FUCHS S, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P337, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-337-2009.;FUCHS S, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V64, P2129, DOI 10.1007/S11069-011-0081-5.;FUCHS S, 2011, NAT HAZARDS, V58, P609, DOI 10.1007/S11069-011-9825-5.;GAUME E, 2009, J HYDROL, V367, P70, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2008.12.028.;GROTHMANN T, 2006, NAT HAZARDS, V38, P101, DOI 10.1007/S11069-005-8604-6.;GRUNTFEST E, 2001, NATO SCI S PRT 2 ENV, V77, P3.;HELLENIC STATISTICAL AUTHORITY, 2011, POP CENS 2011.;HONG Y, 2012, ENCY NATURAL HAZARDS, P324, DOI DOI 10.1007/978-1-4020-4399-4\_136.;HOPKINS J, 2015, DISASTERS, V39, P546, DOI 10.1111/DISA.12120.;KAPPES MS, 2012, APPL GEOGR, V32, P577, DOI 10.1016/J.APGEOG.2011.07.002.;KAPPES MS, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V64, P1925, DOI 10.1007/S11069-012-0294-2.;KARAGIORGOS K, 2013, WILDBACH LAWINENVERB, V170, P264.;KEILER M., 2006, GIS SICHERHEITSMANAG, P118.;KREIBICH H, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P1679, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-1679-2009.;KUHLICKE C, 2011, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V14, P804, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2011.05.001.;KUNDZEWICZ ZW, 1999, HYDROLOG SCI J, V44, P855, DOI 10.1080/02626669909492285.;LAGOUVARDOS K, 1996, J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS, V101, P26217, DOI 10.1029/96JD01385.;LASDA O, 2010, AMBIO, V39, P608, DOI 10.1007/S13280-010-0050-3.;LLASAT MC, 2010, ADV GEOSCI, V23, P47, DOI DOI 10.5194/ADGEO-23-47-2010.;LO AY, 2013, AREA, V45, P70, DOI 10.1111/AREA.12002.;LO WC, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V64, P2107, DOI 10.1007/S11069-012-0124-6.;MANTELAS L, 2012, GEOJOURNAL, V77, P13, DOI 10.1007/S10708-010-9372-8.;MARCHI L, 2010, J HYDROL, V394, P118, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2010.07.017.;MENONI S, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V64, P2057, DOI 10.1007/S11069-012-0134-4.;MERZ R, 2004, J HYDROL, V287, P95, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2003.09.028.;MILETI DS, 1992, SOC PROBL, V39, P40, DOI 10.1525/SP.1992.39.1.03X0062J.;MIMIKOU MA, 1995, US ITALY RES WORKSH.;MONTESARCHIO V, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P135, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-135-2009.;MONTZ B.

269,Lazrus H;Morss Re;Demuth Jl;Lazo Jk;Bostrom A,``know what to do if you encounter a flash flood: mental models analysis for improving flash flood risk communication and public decision making,RISK ANALYSIS,"Understanding how people view flash flood risks can help improve risk communication, ultimately improving outcomes. This article analyzes data from 26 mental models interviews about flash floods with members of the public in boulder, colorado, to understand their perspectives on flash flood risks and mitigation. The analysis includes a comparison between public and professional perspectives by referencing a companion mental models study of boulder-area professionals. A mental models approach can help to diagnose what people already know about flash flood risks and responses, as well as any critical gaps in their knowledge that might be addressed through improved risk communication. A few public interviewees mentioned most of the key concepts discussed by professionals as important for flash flood warning decision making. However, most interviewees exhibited some incomplete understandings and misconceptions about aspects of flash flood development and exposure, effects, or mitigation that may lead to ineffective warning decisions when a flash flood threatens. These include important misunderstandings about the rapid evolution of flash floods, the speed of water in flash floods, the locations and times that pose the greatest flash flood risk in boulder, the value of situational awareness and environmental cues, and the most appropriate responses when a flash flood threatens. The findings point to recommendations for ways to improve risk communication, over the long term and when an event threatens, to help people quickly recognize and understand threats, obtain needed information, and make informed decisions in complex, rapidly evolving extreme weather events such as flash floods.",FLASH FLOODS; MENTAL MODELS; RISK COMMUNICATION; RISK PERCEPTION; WARNING,MITIGATION BEHAVIOR; HAZARDOUS PROCESSES; CLIMATE-CHANGE; UNITED-STATES; PERCEPTIONS; INFORMATION; PEOPLE; WEATHER; CONTEXT; DEATHS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,23,"AMERICAN METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY GLOSSARY OF METEOROLOGY, 2000, AM MET SOC GLOSS MET.;ASHLEY ST, 2008, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V47, P805, DOI 10.1175/2007JAMC1611.1.;ATMAN CJ, 1994, RISK ANAL, V14, P779, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.1994.TB00289.X.;BOSTROM A, 1994, RISK ANAL, V14, P959, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.1994.TB00065.X.;BOSTROM A, 1992, J SOC ISSUES, V48, P85, DOI 10.1111/J.1540-4560.1992.TB01946.X.;BOSTROM A, 2008, J RISK RES, V11, P99.;BOSTROM A, 2012, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V22, P210, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2011.09.012.;BUBECK P, 2012, RISK ANAL, V32, P1481, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.2011.01783.X.;CASMAN E, 2000, RISK ANAL, V20, P493.;CHACON D, 2013, GAZETTE.;CONNELLY NA, 1998, RISK ANAL, V18, P649, DOI 10.1023/B:RIAN.0000005938.42563.13.;DE BRUIN WB, 2013, P NATL ACAD SCI USA, V110, P14062, DOI 10.1073/PNAS.1212729110.;DEKAY ML, 1993, RISK ANAL, V13, P193, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.1993.TB01069.X.;DROBOT S.

454,Laudan J;Zoeller G;Thieken Ah,Flash floods versus river floods - a comparison of psychological impacts and implications for precautionary behaviour,NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"River floods are among the most damaging natural hazards that frequently occur in germany. Flooding causes high economic losses and impacts many residents. In 2016, several southern german municipalities were hit by flash floods after unexpectedly severe heavy rainfall, while in 2013 widespread river flooding had occurred. This study investigates and compares the psychological impacts of river floods and flash floods and potential consequences for precautionary behaviour. Data were collected using computer-aided telephone interviews that were conducted among flood-affected households around 9 months after each damaging event. This study applies bayesian statistics and negative binomial regressions to test the suitability of psychological indicators to predict the precaution motivation of individuals. The results show that it is not the particular flood type but rather the severity and local impacts of the event that are crucial for the different, and potentially negative, impacts on mental health. According to the used data, however, predictions of the individual precaution motivation should not be based on the derived psychological indicators - i.e. Coping appraisal, threat appraisal, burden and evasion - since their explanatory power was generally low and results are, for the most part, non-significant. Only burden reveals a significant positive relation to planned precaution regarding weak flash floods. In contrast to weak flash floods and river floods, the perceived threat of strong flash floods is significantly lower although feelings of burden and lower coping appraisals are more pronounced. Further research is needed to better include psychological assessment procedures and to focus on alternative data sources regarding floods and the connected precaution motivation of affected residents.",,PRIVATE HOUSEHOLDS; RISK PERCEPTIONS; EXTREME RAINFALL; HEALTH; MITIGATION; GERMANY; PEOPLE; DAMAGE; PREPAREDNESS; RESIDENTS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"LAUDAN, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV POTSDAM, INST ENVIRONM SCI \& GEOG, KARL LIEBKNECHT STR 24-25, D-14476 POTSDAM, GERMANY.;LAUDAN, JONAS, THIEKEN, ANNEGRET H., UNIV POTSDAM, INST ENVIRONM SCI \& GEOG, KARL LIEBKNECHT STR 24-25, D-14476 POTSDAM, GERMANY.;ZOELLER, GERT, UNIV POTSDAM, INST MATH, KARL LIEBKNECHT STR 24-25, D-14476 POTSDAM, GERMANY.",10.5194/NHESS-20-999-2020,"BAHNHOFSALLEE 1E, GOTTINGEN, 37081, GERMANY",,DEUTSCHE FORSCHUNGSGEMEINSCHAFTGERMAN RESEARCH FOUNDATION (DFG) [GRK 2043/1],,1561-8633,4,999-1023,COPERNICUS GESELLSCHAFT MBH,20,2020,ISI000526054400002,50,"GEOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",1,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",JLAUDANUNI-POTSDAM.DE,,LD5FJ,,"LAUDAN, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV POTSDAM, INST ENVIRONM SCI \& GEOG, KARL LIEBKNECHT STR 24-25, D-14476 POTSDAM, GERMANY",ISI,UNIV POTSDAM;UNIV POTSDAM,UNIV POTSDAM,,"LAUDAN J, 2020, NAT HAZARDS EARTH SYST SCI","LAUDAN J, 2020, NAT HAZARDS EARTH SYST SCI",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,4,6_11,0,1

This study reports on the results of a quantitative survey of sme owners/managers and employs quantile regression analysis in an attempt to shed light on factors affecting resilience barriers to flash floods. Findings suggest that the effect of organizational size on sme barriers is reduced as barriers increase. In contrast, the effect of organizational age is found to be positive with low magnitudes when barriers are either very low or considerably high in contrast to negative effects when barriers are at moderate levels. A positive influence of the industrial affiliation at all barrier levels is also identified. Previous experience with flash flooding events as well as the effect of profitability are found to have negative impact in most levels of analysis. The assessment highlights the need for targeted intervention and assistance to the various segments of the sme sector through customized guidance and/or ad hoc regulation by focusing on factors explaining barriers to resilience.",FLASH FLOODS; ORGANIZATIONAL RESILIENCE BARRIERS; SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES; CLIMATE CHANGE; ENVIRONMENTAL PERTURBATIONS; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT; CLIMATE-CHANGE ADAPTATION; SMES; RISK; HOUSEHOLDS; EFFICIENCY; MODELS; SYSTEM,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"SKOULOUDIS, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV AEGEAN, CTR ENVIRONM POLICY \& STRATEG ENVIRONM MANAGEMENT, DEPT ENVIRONM, MITILINI 81100, GREECE.;HALKOS, GEORGE, UNIV THESSALY, DEPT ECON, LAB OPERAT RES, VOLOS, GREECE.;SKOULOUDIS, ANTONIS, UNIV AEGEAN, CTR ENVIRONM POLICY \& STRATEG ENVIRONM MANAGEMENT, DEPT ENVIRONM, MITILINI 81100, GREECE.",10.1080/17565529.2019.1596782,"2-4 PARK SQUARE, MILTON PARK, ABINGDON OR14 4RN, OXON, ENGLAND",,,,1756-5529,1,57-66,TAYLOR \& FRANCIS LTD,12,2020,ISI000465838300001,84,"DEVELOPMENT STUDIES, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY",13,"DEVELOPMENT STUDIES, ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES",SKOULOUDISENV.AEGEAN.GR,,KE9KX,,"SKOULOUDIS, A (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV AEGEAN, CTR ENVIRONM POLICY \& STRATEG ENVIRONM MANAGEMENT, DEPT ENVIRONM, MITILINI 81100, GREECE",ISI,UNIV THESSALY;UNIV AEGEAN,UNIV AEGEAN,,"HALKOS G, 2020, CLIM DEV","HALKOS G, 2020, CLIM DEV",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,2,6_11,0,1

Given the reliance of a large segment of the population on the agricultural sector for both their livelihoods as well as national food security, climate change adaptation in the agricultural sector is crucial for continued national food security and economic growth. Using household data from lowland rice farmers of selected haor areas in sylhet, the current work presents an analysis of the determinants behind the implementation of different climate change adaptation strategies by lowland rice farmers. The first objective of this study was to explore the extent of awareness of climate change within this population as well as the type of opinions held by lowland rice farmers with respect to climate change. To serve this purpose, a severity index (si) was developed and subsequently employed to evaluate the perceptions and attitudes of 378 farmers with respect to climate change vulnerability. Respondents were interviewed with respect to climate change related circumstances they faced in their daily lives. Attained si index values ranged from 69.18\% to 93.52\%. The si for the perception ``climate change affects rice production was measured as 93.52\%. Using data collected from the same 378 farmers, a logistic regression was carried out to investigate the impact of socio-economic and institutional factors on adaptation. The results show that credit from non-government organizations is highly statistically significant for adaptation, and that rural market structure also has a positive effect on adaptation. Among the studied factors, credit from non-governmental organizations (ngos) was found to be the most important factor for adaptation. The results of this work further indicate that marginal farmers would benefit from government (gob) funded seasonal training activities that cover pertinent information regarding adaptation after flash floods. Additionally, the authors of this piece recommend timely issuance of government-assisted credit during early flash floods to afflicted farmers, as such an initiative can aid farmers in adapting different strategies to mitigate losses and enhance their productivity as well as livelihood.",PERCEPTION; SEVERITY INDEX; ADAPTATION PLANNING; RICE FARMERS; FLASH FLOOD,EMPIRICAL-EVIDENCE; AGRICULTURE; CHOICE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"FERDUSHI, KF (REPRINT AUTHOR), SHAHJALAL UNIV SCI \& TECHNOL, DEPT STAT, SYLHET 3114, BANGLADESH.;FERDUSHI, KANIS FATAMA, SHAHJALAL UNIV SCI \& TECHNOL, DEPT STAT, SYLHET 3114, BANGLADESH.;ISMAIL, MOHD TAHIR, UNIV SAINS MALAYSIA, SCH MATH SCI, USM PULAU PINANG 11800, MALAYSIA.;KAMIL, ANTON ABDULBASAH, TELKOM UNIV, SCH IND \& SYST ENGN, BANDUNG 40257, INDONESIA.",10.3390/CLI7070085,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,SUST RESEARCH CENTER [PS/2017/17]; [PS/2018/2/26],,2225-1154,7,,MDPI,7,2019,ISI000478759000007,40,METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES,7,METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES,KANISUSMGMAIL.COM,,IN6AT,,"FERDUSHI, KF (REPRINT AUTHOR), SHAHJALAL UNIV SCI \& TECHNOL, DEPT STAT, SYLHET 3114, BANGLADESH",ISI,SHAHJALAL UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL;UNIV SAINS MALAYSIA;TELKOM UNIV,SHAHJALAL UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,,"FERDUSHI KF, 2019, CLIMATE","FERDUSHI KF, 2019, CLIMATE",TRUE,0,1,3,0,0,5,6_11,2,1
448,Ghosh M;Ghosal S,"Climate change vulnerability of rural households in flood-prone areas of himalayan foothills, west bengal, india",ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY,"The himalayan foothills of west bengal are a part of the great eastern himalaya, which is by locational virtue a recognized flood-prone area. The area is also well known for frequent and heavy rain storms and climate-induced catastrophic events, such as flash floods due to the unprecedented rains in the bhutan himalaya. Therefore, climate-induced disasters like floods have been the prime reasons for rural vulnerabilities. Therefore, the primary aim of the present study is to find out whether there are any differences between levels of vulnerability amidst agriculture-dependent villages and forest resource-dependent villages in the same flood-prone area or not. In addition, the study will also examine how the agriculture-dependent villages are different from forest resource-dependent villages in terms of climate vulnerability and vice versa. The climate change vulnerability index has been applied, and a total of 100 households have been surveyed covering seven dimensions of vulnerability. The exposure score was found to be the highest in raja bhatkhawa (0.41) followed by nathuar char (0.30) and bhelakoba (0.27). No significant differences were found in terms of climatic exposure except in mendabari. Further, it has been observed that the resilience factors in households like education, workforce opportunities, health, and institutional accessibility are highly uneven, which has been creating hinders to the adaptive capacity. In the villages where overall vulnerability to climate change was found to be high, the adaptive capacity was found to be low. Simultaneously, in those villages, the sensitivity was found to be high. It has been found that the location of the villages plays an important role when it comes to vulnerability because the forest villages are relatively more vulnerable than the agricultural villages. However, the riverside location of nathuar char has made this village highly vulnerable, and the people of nathuar char have been living with floods, and they are trying to adapt with climate-induced floods. Finally, it has been observed that vulnerability is context dependent (i.e. Based on land resources, accessibility to basic infrastructure, water and sanitation facilities, and awareness to disasters) and varies from household to household.",CLIMATE CHANGE VULNERABILITY; HIMALAYAN FOOTHILLS; LIVELIHOOD STRATEGY; ENVIRONMENTAL PROFILE; LIVELIHOODS INSECURITY,SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; NORTH BENGAL; ADAPTATION; POVERTY; IMPACTS; INDEX; RISKS,ENGLISH,"ARTICLE, EARLY ACCESS",ARTICLE,0,none,"GHOSH, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), INDIAN INST TECHNOL KHARAGPUR, RURAL DEV CTR, KHARAGPUR 721302, W BENGAL, INDIA.;GHOSH, MANORANJAN, GHOSAL, SOMNATH, INDIAN INST TECHNOL KHARAGPUR, RURAL DEV CTR, KHARAGPUR 721302, W BENGAL, INDIA.",10.1007/S10668-020-00687-0,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,,1387-585X,,,SPRINGER,,,ISI000521875600001,62,"SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY",9,"GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES",GHOSHMANORANJAN.99GMAIL.COM SOMNATHIITKGP.AC.IN,,KX4UR,,"GHOSH, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), INDIAN INST TECHNOL KHARAGPUR, RURAL DEV CTR, KHARAGPUR 721302, W BENGAL, INDIA",ISI,INDIAN INST TECHNOL KHARAGPUR,INDIAN INST TECHNOL KHARAGPUR,,"GHOSH M, NA, ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN","GHOSH M, NA, ENVIRON DEV SUSTAIN",FALSE,0,1,2,0,0,0,6_11,2,1

The wetland region (haor) of northeastern (ne) bangladesh was severely affected by flash floods early in 2017, affecting nearly 1 million households and damaging us \$ 450 million worth of rice crops. This study investigates how the ne bangladesh experienced the 2017 flash floods, and to what degree the wetland communities are vulnerable and resilience to flash floods. Focus group discussion, key informant interviews, and household questionnaire surveys (n=80) were applied in the study area of sunamganj district. Results from statistical analyses and regression modelling reveal that poor people are particularly vulnerable to floods but they are also more adaptive and thus resilient, middle-income households are vulnerable as they are hesitant to take up any jobs and accept flood relief, and rich households, despite being less adaptive, are able to recover from flood disasters because of wealth. This study reveals that resilience also stems from deep religious faith in the haor inhabitants that supports communities to move on by accepting that most natural calamities such as flash floods are divine tests. This study also finds that women are particularly vulnerable and less resilient as they are not normally allowed to work outside of their homes and beyond the haor communities due to cultural and religious reasons.",FLASH FLOODING; RESILIENCE; VULNERABILITY; LIVELIHOODS; HAOR REGION; BANGLADESH,DISASTER RISK REDUCTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"ALAM A.B.M.S., 2012, BIODIVERSITY TANGUAR.;ALEXANDER DE, 2013, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V13, P2707, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-13-2707-2013.;ALEXANDER D, 2012, INT J DISAST RISK RE, V2, P1, DOI 10.1016/J.IJDRR.2012.10.002.;AVEN T, 2011, RISK ANAL, V31, P515, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.2010.01528.X.;BAMFORTH T., 2017, GUARDIAN.;BANGLAPEDIA S, 2003, BANGLAPEDIA NATL ENC.;BBS, 2011, POP HOUS CENS 2011.;BRAMMER H, 1990, GEOGR J, V156, P12, DOI 10.2307/635431.;CEGIS, 2012, MAST PLAN HAOR AR SU, V1.;CHOUDHURY MU, 2016, INT J DISAST RISK RE, V19, P145, DOI 10.1016/J.IJDRR.2016.08.004.;DASTAGIR MR, 2015, WEATHER CLIM EXTREME, V7, P49, DOI 10.1016/J.WACE.2014.10.003.;HASHEM M.A., 2017, STATUS FLASH FLOOD F.;KEIM ME, 2008, AM J PREV MED, V35, P508, DOI 10.1016/J.AMEPRE.2008.08.022.;KHAN A.L., 2015, CLIMATE CHANGE MODEL, P159.;KUNDZEWICZ ZW, 2014, HYDROLOG SCI J, V59, P1, DOI 10.1080/02626667.2013.857411.;LEWIS J, 1999, DEV DISASTER PRONE P.;LEWIS J, 2013, DISASTER PREV MANAG, V22, P300, DOI 10.1108/DPM-03-2013-0053.;MIRZA MMQ, 2003, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V57, P287, DOI 10.1023/A:1022825915791.;MIRZA MMQ, 2002, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V12, P127, DOI 10.1016/S0959-3780(02)00002-X.;PARVIN GA, 2016, CLIMATE, V4, DOI 10.3390/CLI4040060.;PUGH J, 2014, AREA, V46, P313, DOI 10.1111/AREA.12118.;REID J, 2012, DEV DIALOGUE, V58, P67.;SALAUDIN M., 2011, P 3 INT C WAT FLOOD.;SUDMEIER-RIEUX KI, 2014, DISASTER PREV MANAG, V23, P67, DOI 10.1108/DPM-12-2012-0143.;SUMAN A, 2015, HYDROL RES, V46, P824, DOI 10.2166/NH.2014.065.;WARPO, 2000, NAT WAT MAN PLAN NWM.;WISNER B., 2004, RISK NATURAL HAZARDS.","SHAMSUDDUHA, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), UCL, INST RISK \& DISASTER REDUCT, LONDON, ENGLAND.;KAMAL, A.

We selected two districts in bangladesh that are vulnerable to extreme weather events: sunamganj, which experiences flash flooding, and brahmanbaria, which experiences cyclones and related floods. Survey data was collected from 120 randomly selected household heads from two villages in these districts, and in-depth interviews were conducted with 40 household heads who indicated early marriage was a coping strategy for managing effects of weather events. The mixed-methods study finds that early marriage of daughters is a coping strategy for managing two negative consequences of extreme weather events. First, by minimizing household expenses, householders can pay for damage-related expenses. Second, unmarried daughters may be subject to sexual violence during a crisis, especially in temporary shelters, which would harm both the family's and daughter's reputation and prevent future marriage.",BANGLADESH; EARLY MARRIAGE; EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS; POVERTY; SEXUAL VIOLENCE; VULNERABLE AREAS,CHILD MARRIAGE; CLIMATE-CHANGE; 1ST MARRIAGE; WOMEN; ADAPTATION; DETERMINANTS; CHALLENGES; AUTONOMY; POVERTY; IMPACTS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,none,"HAQ, SMA (REPRINT AUTHOR), CATHOLIC UNIV LOUVAIN, NATL FUND SCI RES, LOUVAIN LA NEUVE, BELGIUM.;HAQ, SMA (REPRINT AUTHOR), CATHOLIC UNIV LOUVAIN, CTR DEMOG RES, LOUVAIN LA NEUVE, BELGIUM.;HAQ, SMA (REPRINT AUTHOR), SHAHJALAL UNIV SCI \& TECHNOL, DEPT SOCIOL, SYLHET 3114, BANGLADESH.;AHMED, KHANDAKER JAFOR, UNIV ADELAIDE, DEPT GEOG ENVIRONM \& POPULAT, ADELAIDE, SA 5005, AUSTRALIA.;HAQ, SHAH MD ATIQUL, BARTIAUX, FRANCOISE, CATHOLIC UNIV LOUVAIN, NATL FUND SCI RES, LOUVAIN LA NEUVE, BELGIUM.;HAQ, SHAH MD ATIQUL, BARTIAUX, FRANCOISE, CATHOLIC UNIV LOUVAIN, CTR DEMOG RES, LOUVAIN LA NEUVE, BELGIUM.;HAQ, SHAH MD ATIQUL, SHAHJALAL UNIV SCI \& TECHNOL, DEPT SOCIOL, SYLHET 3114, BANGLADESH.",10.1007/S11111-019-0312-3,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,,0199-0039,3,303-324,SPRINGER,40,2019,ISI000462306400004,78,"DEMOGRAPHY, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY",11,"DEMOGRAPHY, ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES",KHANDAKER.AHMEDADELAIDE.EDU.AU SHAH.ATIQULHAQUCLOUVAIN.BE FRANCOISE.BARTIAUXUCLOUVAIN.BE,,HQ3JE,,"HAQ, SMA (REPRINT AUTHOR), CATHOLIC UNIV LOUVAIN, NATL FUND SCI RES, LOUVAIN LA NEUVE, BELGIUM",ISI,UNIV ADELAIDE;CATHOLIC UNIV LOUVAIN;CATHOLIC UNIV LOUVAIN;SHAHJALAL UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL,CATHOLIC UNIV LOUVAIN,,"AHMED KJ, 2019, POPUL ENV","AHMED KJ, 2019, POPUL ENV",FALSE,0,5,0,0,0,2_7,6_11,1,1

Jeddah, a coastal city situated in saudi arabia, has experienced severe flash flood events in recent years. With intense rainfall, extensive coastal developments, and sensitive ecosystems, the city is susceptible to severe flash flood risks. The objective of this article is to apply an analytic hierarchy process (ahp) model to explore the impacts of flash flood hazards and identify the most effective approaches to reducing the flash flood impacts in jeddah using expert's opinions. The study utilizes experts' judgments and employs the ahp for data analyses and modeling. The results indicated that property loss has the highest probability of occurrence in the events of a flash flood with a priority level of 42\%, followed by productivity loss (28\%). Injuries and death were rated the least priority of 18\% and 12\%, respectively. Concerning flood impact reduction alternatives, river management (41\%) and early warning system (38\%) are the most favorable options.

80,Toufique Ka;Islam A,Assessing risks from climate variability and change for disaster-prone zones in bangladesh,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,"We have measured livelihoods vulnerability indices for four disaster prone zones in bangladesh, namely saline, flood, flash flood and drought. A total of 2558 households were surveyed to collect data on socio-demographics, livelihoods, social networks, health, food and water security, natural disasters and climate variability. The data were aggregated using a composite index and vulnerabilities across the four disaster prone areas were compared. Our results show that the flash flood zone is the most vulnerable zone followed by the saline, drought and flood zones respectively. The flash flood zone is mainly a mono-rice crop area and local livelihood opportunities are uncertain and limited. Road infrastructure is poor as a large part of this zone remains under water in the wet season. Public health services are underprovided and the hospitals are understaffed, sanitary conditions are poor and the households suffer a longer period of food insecurity. The poor households living in the saline zone have to depend more on social networks and local authorities to withstand livelihood shocks brought about by natural disasters such as tidal surges, cyclones and increasing salinity. The drought and saline zones are highly vulnerable to water. Water in these zones is not only scarce but also unsafe for drinking. The saline zone also suffers from salinity in water used for irrigation which has already affected productivity of land. We suggest an increase in public spending on sanitation and drinking water, health and rural infrastructure particularly in the disaster prone areas where incidence of poverty is high.

351,Maiwald H;Schwarz J,The flash flood of braunsbach - engineering analysis of the building damage,BAUTECHNIK,"At the end of may to the beginning of june, a series of extreme rainfall events occurred in the southern part of germany, which triggered some severe flash floods with significant building damage in the affected municipalities. The devastating flash flood of may 29, 2016 in braunsbach in the district schwabisch hall in baden-wurttemberg caused heavy structural damage to some of the approximately 130 affected buildings. The paper gives an overview of the building damages documented immediately after the event. The damages cases were classified and assessed using the evaluation system of the edac-flood damage model developed at the earthquake damage analysis center (edac) of the bauhaus-universitat weimar. The analysis illustrates the particularities of the damage patterns due to flash floods compared to conventional river floods.",FLASH FLOOD; HYDRODYNAMIC LOADS; BUILDING DAMAGE; DAMAGE SURVEY; DAMAGE ASSESSMENT,,GERMAN,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,"AGARWAL A., 2016, STURZFLUT BRAUNSBACH.;BECKER A., 2016, ANDAUERNDE GROSSWETT.;BUNDESMINISTERIUM FUR UMWELT NATURSCHUTZ BAU UND REAKTORSICHERHEIT (BMUB), 2015, HOCHW OBJ BAUL VORS, V6.;CLAUSEN L, 1990, INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON RIVER FLOOD HYDRAULICS, P369.;MAIWALD H., 2014, BAUTECHNIK, V91, P354.;MAIWALD H., 2011, SCI TECHNICAL REPORT, V01-11.;MAIWALD H., 2007, THESIS.;MAIWALD H, 2016, BAUTECHNIK, V93, P254, DOI 10.1002/BATE.201500092.;MAIWALD H, 2009, BAUTECHNIK, V86, P550, DOI 10.1002/BATE.200910056.;MUHR B., 2016, HOCHWASSER UBERSCHWE.;SCHWARZ J., 2006, WALDKIRCH ERDBEBEN B, V83, P202.;SCHWARZ J, 2007, BAUTECHNIK, V84, P450, DOI 10.1002/BATE.200710039.;SCHWARZ J, 2015, BAUTECHNIK, V92, P647, DOI 10.1002/BATE.201500035.;VOLKWEIN A., 2014, FLEXIBLE MAURGANGBAR, V8.","MAIWALD, H (REPRINT AUTHOR), ZENTRUM INGENIEURANAL ERDBEBENSCHADEN ERDBEBENZEN, MARIENSTR 13, D-99421 WEIMAR, GERMANY.;MAIWALD, HOLGER, SCHWARZ, JOCHEN, ZENTRUM INGENIEURANAL ERDBEBENSCHADEN ERDBEBENZEN, MARIENSTR 13, D-99421 WEIMAR, GERMANY.",10.1002/BATE.201600087,"ROTHERSTRASSE 21, BERLIN, DEUTSCHLAND 10245, GERMANY",,,,0932-8351,12,925-932,ERNST \& SOHN,93,2016,ISI000392718400006,14,ENGINEERING,6,"ENGINEERING, CIVIL",,,EI7XR,,"MAIWALD, H (REPRINT AUTHOR), ZENTRUM INGENIEURANAL ERDBEBENSCHADEN ERDBEBENZEN, MARIENSTR 13, D-99421 WEIMAR, GERMANY",ISI,SCHWARZ,ZENTRUM INGENIEURANAL ERDBEBENSCHADEN ERDBEBENZEN,,"MAIWALD H, 2016, BAUTECHNIK","MAIWALD H, 2016, BAUTECHNIK",TRUE,2,0,0,0,0,6,6_11_12_16,1,2
196,Mkandawire P,Vulnerability of hiv/aids orphans to floods in malawi,GEOFORUM,"Referred to as the `forgotten causalities' of climate change (cutter 1995), very few studies have examined the precise nature and magnitude of climate change impacts on children, let alone on the growing number of orphans and vulnerable children in sub-sahara africa (ssa), where climate change is already expected to exact its worst humanitarian toll. This paper examines personal, familial, and contextual circumstances that arise when children lose their parents to hiv/aids and how these situations mediate exposure to the impacts of climate related disasters. Using the case of flash floods that occurred in malawi in 2015, and drawing on perspectives from political ecology and social vulnerability theory, the findings of a qualitative study (n=51) suggest that orphans' vulnerability to floods was mediated by a number of specific circumstances. These include pre-existing physical health status of surviving parent or guardian, domestic roles they inherited following incapacitation or death of a parent, and social norms governing property inheritance within the traditional extended family system. In addition, the findings also show that the floods shattered livelihoods, forcing orphans into prolonged engagement in exploitative labour pursuits. Furthermore, the findings show that the rainstorm also swept away mementos left behind by parents, with profound effect on orphans' emotional wellbeing, which affected their interpretation of the meaning of the disaster. The study underscores (i) the potential of climate change to re-configure social relations and entrench orphans' subordinate status (ii) the historical specificity of the factors that mediate the effects of climate change on children.",ORPHANS; CHILDREN; FLOODS; VULNERABILITY; CLIMATE CHANGE; MALAWI,CLIMATE-CHANGE; POLITICAL ECOLOGY; SOUTHERN AFRICA; CHILDREN; ADAPTATION; POVERTY; CARERS; HIV,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,"ADGER WN, 2009, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V93, P335, DOI 10.1007/S10584-008-9520-Z.;ADGER WN, 1999, WORLD DEV, V27, P249, DOI 10.1016/S0305-750X(98)00136-3.;AJIBADE I, 2013, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V23, P1714, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2013.08.009.;BARTLETT S, 2008, ENVIRON URBAN, V20, P501, DOI 10.1177/0956247808096125.;BAUMAN LJ, 2006, VULNERABLE CHILD YOU, V1, P56, DOI 10.1080/17450120600659077.;BERRY HL, 2010, INT J PUBLIC HEALTH, V55, P123, DOI 10.1007/S00038-009-0112-0.;BLAIKIE P, 2008, GEOFORUM, V39, P765, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOFORUM.2007.07.004.;BRYCESON DF, 2006, J MOD AFR STUD, V44, P173, DOI 10.1017/S0022278X06001595.;CANNON T., 2002, GENDER DEV, V10, P45, DOI DOI 10.1080/13552070215906.;CHIRWA W., 2002, NORDIC J AFRICAN STU, V11, P93.;COSTELLO A, 2009, LANCET, V373, P1693, DOI [10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60935-1, 10.1016/S0140-6736(09)60929-6].;CUTTER SL, 1995, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V5, P181, DOI 10.1016/0959-3780(95)00046-Q.;DRIMIE S., 2008, FAMILIES EFFORTS SEC, V1.;DRIMIE S, 2010, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V13, P778, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2010.07.003.;DRIMIE S, 2009, AIDS CARE, V21, P28, DOI 10.1080/09540120902942931.;EVANS R, 2009, CHILDREN CARING PARE.;FOSTER GEOFF, 2005, GENERATION RISK GLOB.;FRITZE JESSICA G, 2008, INT J MENT HEALTH SYST, V2, P13, DOI 10.1186/1752-4458-2-13.;GREENE S, 2005, RES CHILDRENS EXPERI.;HORTON G, 2010, AUSTRALAS J AGEING, V29, P2, DOI 10.1111/J.1741-6612.2010.00424.X.;IZUMI K, 2007, GENDER DEV, V15, P11, DOI DOI 10.1080/13552070601178823.;KALIPENI E., 2004, HIV AIDS AFRICA EPID.;KERR RB, 2005, RURAL SOCIOL, V70, P167, DOI 10.1526/0036011054776370.;LOHMANN RI, 2010, ANTHROPOL FORUM, V20, P291, DOI 10.1080/00664677.2010.515295.;MALAWI GOVERNMENT, 2014, WELF MON SURV.;MENDENHALL E, 2007, AIDS CARE, V19, P369, DOI 10.1080/09540120600774362.;MILES M.

21,Ajibade I;Mcbean G;Bezner-Kerr R,"Urban flooding in lagos, nigeria: patterns of vulnerability and resilience among women",GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGE-HUMAN AND POLICY DIMENSIONS,"We report findings from a mixed method study of women's gendered experiences with flash floods in the coastal city of lagos, nigeria. Drawing on narrative accounts from 36 interviews, a survey (n=453) and 6 focus group discussions, we investigate the impacts of floods in general and specifically the july 2011 flood event on women's lives, livelihoods, and health. We draw on complementary perspectives from feminist political ecology and social vulnerability theory to understand the ways in which such events are perceived, experienced and managed by women of different socio-economic classes, households, and geographic locations. Thematic and content analyses were used to examine women's perceptions of floods, while descriptive statistical analysis and chi-square test were employed to compare actual impacts. Results show that women in general expressed no concern about gendered vulnerability to flooding as most believed flood impacts were gender neutral. This dominant view however, was not supported by evidence in the post-july 2011 flooding as impacts varied among income groups and neighbourhoods, and gender differences were apparent. Women in the low-income neighbourhood recorded higher impacts and slower recovery compared to other social categories of women and men. All impacts reported were statistically significant between women in low and high income neighbourhoods but most were not significant between women in middle and high income neighbourhoods. Gender relations and roles intersecting with place, class, employment status, and healthcare, were mediating factors that placed low-income women at greater risk of impacts than others. With climate change likely to induce more extreme events, a case is made for collaborative and institutional efforts to systematically boost urban poor women's adaptive capacity through targeted programmes aimed at alleviating poverty and improving women's access to housing, health care and alternative sources of livelihoods.

On november 15, 2017, 24 people were killed and hundreds were left homeless in the vicinities of the towns of mandra and nea peramos in attica region, greece, as a result of a catastrophic flash flood triggered by extreme rainfall. The impact of such events has been the focus of studies for years consistently indicating adverse effects ranging from short to long term, on post-disaster physical and psychological health. This paper explores the initial impact of extreme flash floods on communities in terms of psychological and physical health, by means of a self-report questionnaire. Findings are investigated in relation to demographic variables and vulnerability predictors. Self-reports differed prior and after the flash flood, with negative changes in both domains. Results indicated significant differences in both physical and physiological health by gender, age, marital and occupational status. According to spearman's correlation coefficient, physical and psychological effects showed moderately positive correlations for most independent variables. Results indicate a need to align prevention, aid and intervention strategies in the recovery phase and address issues such as public awareness, information provision and post disaster coping strategies.",FLASH FLOOD; HEALTH IMPACTS; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH,PHYSICAL HEALTH; RISK PERCEPTION; MENTAL-HEALTH; DISASTER; GENDER; PREPAREDNESS; IMPACTS; AGE; CIRCUMSTANCES; POPULATION,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"ANDREADAKIS, E (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ATHENS, FAC GEOL \& GEOENVIRONM, GR-15784 PANEPISTIMIOUPOLI, ZOGRAFOU, GREECE.;SPEIS, PHOEBE-DEMETER, ANDREADAKIS, EMMANUEL, DIAKAKIS, MICHALIS, DAIDASSI, EVANTHIA, SARIGIANNIS, GEORGIOS, UNIV ATHENS, FAC GEOL \& GEOENVIRONM, GR-15784 PANEPISTIMIOUPOLI, ZOGRAFOU, GREECE.",10.1016/J.IJDRR.2019.101285,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,,2212-4209,,,ELSEVIER,41,2019,ISI000504924200034,82,"GEOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",9,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",EANDREADKGEOL.UOA.GR,,JZ2HI,,"ANDREADAKIS, E (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV ATHENS, FAC GEOL \& GEOENVIRONM, GR-15784 PANEPISTIMIOUPOLI, ZOGRAFOU, GREECE",ISI,UNIV ATHENS,UNIV ATHENS,,"SPEIS PD, 2019, INT J DISASTER RISK REDUCT","SPEIS PD, 2019, INT J DISASTER RISK REDUCT",TRUE,0,5,0,0,0,3_4,6_11_16,1,2

Method: we carried out a retrospective study to examine the occurrence and the determinants of ptsd in victims of flood in 1998 and 1999 in hunan, china. We used multistage sampling to select the subjects from the flood areas, and we ascertained ptsd according to dsm-iv criteria. Data were collected in face-to-face interviews carried out by experienced research assistants using a preconstructed questionnaire. We used a multiple logistic regression model to analyze the data. Results: a total of 33 340 subjects (86.0\% of the selected subjects, aged 7 years or over) in the study villages were interviewed. Among them, 2875 (8.6\%) had symptoms that met the diagnostic criteria for ptsd. Significant risk factors for ptsd included female sex (odds ratio [or] 1.12, 95\% confidence interval [ci], 1.04 to 1.21), older age (age 18 to 59 years or 2.28, 95\%ci, 2.02 to 2.57, and age >= 60 years or 2.42, 95\%ci, 2.05 to 2.85), flood type (collapsed embankment or 1.84, 95\%ci, 1.64 to 2.05, and flash flood or 3.12, 95\%ci, 2.76 to 3.52), and flood severity (intermediate or 4.05, 95\%ci, 3.55 to 4.62, and severe or 2.98, 95\%ci, 2.60 to 3.41).

While there is considerable information about the immediate impact on those affected, there is less understanding of the long-term health effects that follow such events. This study explored the perceptions of health effects and support received by people affected by the 2011 southeast queensland flood six years after the event. A cross-sectional survey of 327 people was conducted in areas affected by the floods. The questionnaire sought information about the ongoing social, economic, demographic and self-declared physical and mental health effects. The data were analysed through comparison of those unaffected with those directly affected by the floods. Residents whose households were flooded were more likely to score their health negatively than non-affected residents and had higher reported rates of trauma, injury and mental illness. Twenty-six per cent of this group reported that they still experience some adverse health effects from the floods. Managing the longterm health implications of a flood-affected population is an important public policy task. Dissatisfaction with recovery operations and perceived injustices associated with insurance and compensation arrangements may aggravate health consequences.

Generally, it occurs due to slope failure, flash flooding and high rainfall. Anthropogenic factors further accentuate its intensity. It has negative impacts on the environment and economy of the affected regions as well as oil flora and fauna. Similarly, debris flow impacts the economy with loss of agricultural land, existing crops, settlements, public and private property and human lives. A case study of two debris-flow zones of file pindar basin of the garhwal himalaya has been carried out. The intensity and magnitude of debris flow in two zones vary from each other. In both, debris flows resulted from high precipitation (cloudbursts) in the highlands and their impacts were concentrated in the valley regions (gangar). The highlands are characterized by dense forest and steep slopes, while valley regions are characterized by gentle slopes with vast agricultural fields and human settlements. Heavy losses of life and in the economy and environment recur. This paper aims to examine the impact of debris flows on the environment and economy of the affected areas of the garhwal himalaya in general and two case-study zones in particular.

252,Michalis D;Efthymis L;Iraklis S;Evangelos M,Vulnerability of transport infrastructure to extreme weather events in small rural catchments,EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF TRANSPORT AND INFRASTRUCTURE RESEARCH,"Across the mediterranean region, extreme weather events (ewe), such as high-intensity storms causing flooding in small river basins, are one of the most common types of hydrometeorological hazards. Flooding has been associated with severe effects on road networks and a significant number of vehicle-related fatalities, raising concerns regarding the performance of transportation infrastructure during ewes. Given the expected increase in frequency of such events within the context of climate change, an assessment of its vulnerability is particularly crucial. The work presented herein evaluates the performance of transportation infrastructure during high-intensity storms. This research focuses on small rural catchments, examining the impact of five extreme storm events in five rural basins in greece. Post-flood surveys were conducted, to record the impact of inundation on each infrastructure element in the five catchments. Overall, findings showed that road infrastructure, especially river crossings, performed poorly, restricting access to large areas during and after the events, affecting the safety of commuters and sustaining extensive damages. On average, it was found that 73\% of the river crossings and 11.5\% of the total length of the road network were inundated or damaged, while a total of 12 individuals died during the events. The results revealed that the impact of flooding in the transportation infrastructure of small rural basins was severe and a threat to human life. The findings of this study indicate that authorities should consider taking measures during ewes, re-examine the safety features of the relevant infrastructure and assess the risk related to its failure.",FLASH FLOODS; EXTREME WEATHER EVENTS; CLIMATE CHANGE; TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE; VEHICLE ACCIDENTS,FLOOD FATALITIES; FLASH FLOODS; IMPACTS; SPAIN; RAINSTORMS; AREA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"ASHLEY ST, 2008, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V47, P805, DOI 10.1175/2007JAMC1611.1.;BELMONTE AMC, 2001, CATENA, V45, P229.;BULL LJ, 2000, CATENA, V38, P191, DOI 10.1016/S0341-8162(99)00071-5.;CHANGNON SA, 1999, J APPL METEOROL, V38, P273, DOI 10.1175/1520-0450(1999)038<0273:RFPROJ>2.0.CO,2.;CHATMAN DG, 2011, TRANSPORT REV, V31, P725, DOI 10.1080/01441647.2011.587908.;DANKERS R., 2008, JOINT RES CTR SCI TE.;DENG TT, 2013, TRANSPORT REV, V33, P686, DOI 10.1080/01441647.2013.851745.;DIAKAKIS M, 2013, ENVIRON HAZARDS-UK, V12, P278, DOI 10.1080/17477891.2013.832651.;EEA, 2006, CORINE LAND COV.;EUROPEAN TRUCK ACCIDENT CAUSATION (ETAC), 2007, INT ROAD UN IRU EUR.;FRENCH J, 1983, PUBLIC HEALTH REP, V98, P584.;GAUME E, 2009, J HYDROL, V367, P70, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2008.12.028.;HNMS, 1980, RAINF DAT 1980 MAR S.;JONKMAN SN, 2005, DISASTERS, V29, P75, DOI 10.1111/J.0361-3666.2005.00275.X.;KATSETSIADOU K., 2011, THESIS.;KOTSIS A.

551,Spitalar M;Brilly M;Kos D;Ziberna A,Analysis of flood fatalities-slovenian illustration,WATER,"Floods not only induce vast economic damages but also pose a great danger to human life. In slovenia, floods rank number one on the scale of damage magnitude. Different factors external to the hazard of flooding influence the gravity and extent of the impacts. A comprehensive collection and analysis of the information related to the understanding of causative factors of human impacts can substantially contribute to the mitigation and the minimisation of fatalities and injuries. In this work, historical analysis was performed for flood fatalities in the years between 1926 and 2014, with 10 flood events that induced 74 casualties considered. A detailed collection and review on human impacts was made. Victims in cars have seemed to increase in recent years and rural areas tend to be more vulnerable and susceptible to having victims of flooding. With regards to gender, the majority of victims are male. The focus was on demographic aspects (age and gender) of fatalities and analysis of the circumstances of loss of life. Based on a description of the activities of victims during flood events and repetitive patterns, groups were made based on the type of flood fatality. Eight interviews were performed with rescuers and people who were affected by floods in order to obtain more extensive information on preventative measures, received help, and flood risk perception.",FLOODS; FATALITIES; CIRCUMSTANCES OF LOSS OF LIFE; HISTORICAL ANALYSIS,FLASH FLOODS; CIRCUMSTANCES; LIFE; VULNERABILITY; PARAMETERS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"SPITALAR, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV LJUBLJANA, FAC CIVIL \& GEODET ENGN, LJUBLJANA 1000, SLOVENIA.;SPITALAR, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV LJUBLJANA, FAC SOCIAL SCI, LJUBLJANA 1000, SLOVENIA.;SPITALAR, MARUSA, BRILLY, MITJA, UNIV LJUBLJANA, FAC CIVIL \& GEODET ENGN, LJUBLJANA 1000, SLOVENIA.;SPITALAR, MARUSA, KOS, DRAGO, ZIBERNA, ALES, UNIV LJUBLJANA, FAC SOCIAL SCI, LJUBLJANA 1000, SLOVENIA.",10.3390/W12010064,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,,,,1,,MDPI,12,2020,ISI000519847200064,32,WATER RESOURCES,0,WATER RESOURCES,MARUSASPITALARYAHOO.CO.UK MITJA.BRILLYFGG.UNI-LJ.SI DRAGO.KOSFDV.UNI-LJ.SI ALES.ZIBERNAFDV.UNI-LJ.SI,,KU6TM,,"SPITALAR, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV LJUBLJANA, FAC CIVIL \& GEODET ENGN, LJUBLJANA 1000, SLOVENIA",ISI,UNIV LJUBLJANA;UNIV LJUBLJANA,UNIV LJUBLJANA,,"SPITALAR M, 2020, WATER","SPITALAR M, 2020, WATER",FALSE,0,5_7,3,0,0,1_7,6_13,2,1
187,Sardou M;Maouche S;Missoum H,Compilation of historical floods catalog of northwestern algeria: first step towards an atlas of extreme floods,ARABIAN JOURNAL OF GEOSCIENCES,"Floods are among the significant natural hazards in algeria. They cause severe casualties, damage to building and destruction of roads, public works, and infrastructures. Northwestern algeria has experienced devastating floods in the past that caused considerable damage, e. G., mohammadia 1881, mostaganem 1927, and el asnam 1966. Analysis of historical floods is one of the major tools in flood hazard assessment that enables predicting future flood events. One of the objectives of this work is to address the gap of available information regarding the floods that happened in algeria, particularly during historical times. The first historical data analysis that we performed on the basis of an intensive survey shows that the study area is subject to flooding. This inventory is the first step towards flood zonation and construction of an atlas of extreme floods in northwestern algeria. The catalog of historical floods contains more than 127 documented events. As results, this paper presents a method of compiling historical flooding data and the analysis of the obtained database which represents a major contribution to flood risk assessment.",CATALOG; COMPILATION; HISTORICAL FLOODS; NORTHWESTERN ALGERIA,FLASH FLOODS; EUROPE; SPAIN; EVOLUTION; LANDSLIDE; EVENTS; FRANCE; RISK; AREA,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"ACHITE M, 2004, SECHERESSE, V15, P367.;AISSAT D, 2006, U HASSIBA BEN BOUALI, P142.;ARGENCE S., 2006, ADV GEOSCI, V7, P251, DOI DOI 10.5194/ADGEO-7-251-2006.;BACHI M, 2011, U ABOUBAKR BELKAID T, P128.;BARNOLAS M, 2007, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V7, P271, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-7-271-2007.;BARREDO JI, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P97, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-97-2009.;BARREDO JI, 2007, NAT HAZARDS, V42, P125, DOI 10.1007/S11069-006-9065-2.;BARRERA A, 2006, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V6, P505, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-6-505-2006.;BARRIENDOS M, 2003, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V3, P583, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-3-583-2003.;BENABBESA S, 2005, CTR U KHEMIS MILIANA, P106.;BENDJELID A, 2010, VILLES ALGERIE FORMA, P213.;BOUANANI A, 2011, THESIS U ABOUBEKR BE, P250.;BOUASRIA S, 2010, EUR J SCI RES, P172.;BOUCHETATA ARSLAN, 2006, SECHERESSE (MONTROUGE), V17, P415.;LLASAT MC, 2014, ATMOS RES, V149, P230, DOI 10.1016/J.ATMOSRES.2014.05.024.;CHEIKH LOUNIS G, 2009, P 6 EUR C REG GEOSC, V1, P328.;COEUR D, 2002, AVALANCHES RISQUES R, P133.;CREUTIN JD, 2003, HYDROL PROCESS, V17, P1453, DOI 10.1002/HYP.5122.;DIAKAKIS M, 2014, J FLOOD RISK MANAG, V7, P332, DOI 10.1111/JFR3.12053.;DIAKAKIS M, 2011, ADV RES AQUAT ENV, V1, DOI [10.1007/978-3-642-19902-8, DOI 10.1007/978-3-642-19902-8].;GAUME E, 2009, J HYDROL, V367, P70, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2008.12.028.;GUZZETTI F, 2004, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V4, P213, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-4-213-2004.;GUZZETTI F, 1994, ENVIRON MANAGE, V18, P623, DOI 10.1007/BF02400865.;HALLOUCHE BACHIR, 2010, SECHERESSE (MONTROUGE), V21, P219, DOI 10.1684/SEC.2010.0253.;KETROUCI KHADIDJA, 2012, SECHERESSE (MONTROUGE), V23, P297, DOI 10.1684/SEC.2012.0353.;KJELDSEN TR, 2014, J HYDROL, V517, P963, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2014.06.038.;KOURI LAKHDAR, 2010, SECHERESSE (MONTROUGE), V21, P257, DOI 10.1684/SEC.2010.0248.;LLASAT MC, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P2049, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-2049-2009.;LLASAT M.C., 2010, ADV GEOSCI, V26, P105, DOI DOI 10.5194/ADGE0-26-105-2010.;LLASAT MC, 2005, J HYDROL, V313, P32, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2005.02.004.;LLASAT MC, 2010, ADV GEOSCI, V23, P47, DOI DOI 10.5194/ADGEO-23-47-2010.;LLASAT MD, 2004, HOUILLE BLANCHE, P37.;MARCHI L, 2010, J HYDROL, V394, P118, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2010.07.017.;MARCHI L, 2007, ENVIRON MANAGE, V40, P493, DOI 10.1007/S00267-006-0288-5.;MEDDI M, 2009, PHYSIO-GEO, V3, P61, DOI 10.4000/PHYSIO-GEO.686.;MENAD W, 2012, THESIS U PARIS DIDER.;MUNICH RE GROUP, 2003, ANN REV NAT CAT 2002, P62.;NAULET R, 2002, THESIS U J FOURIER G, P322.;NOUACEUR Z, 2013, PHYSIO-GEO, V7, DOI 10.4000/PHYSIO-GEO.3686.;OUFELLA O, 2005, J EAU ENV ENSH BLIDA, P56.;PAYRASTRE O, 2005, THESIS ECOLE NATL PO, P392.;PETRUCCI O, 2003, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V3, P17, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-3-17-2003.;PRICE C, 2011, SURV GEOPHYS, V32, P733, DOI 10.1007/S10712-011-9146-Y.;SALVATI P, 2010, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V10, P465, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-10-465-2010.;SARDOU M, 2011, MEMOIRE MAGISTER U M, P171.;SAVVIDOU K, 2008, ADV SCI RES, V2, P127, DOI 10.5194/ASR-2-127-2008.;TIDJANI B, 1999, GEOGRAPHIE AMENAGEME, V6, P1.;YAHIAOUI A, 2011, REV SCI EAU, V24, P103, DOI [10.7202/1006105AR, DOI 10.7202/1006105AR].;ZEKOUDA N, 2009, MEMOIRE MAGISTER U H.","MAOUCHE, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), CRAAG, BP 63, ALGIERS 16340, ALGERIA.;SARDOU, MILOUD, MISSOUM, HANIFI, FAC SCI \& TECHNOL, MOSTAGANEM 27000, ALGERIA.;MAOUCHE, SAID, CRAAG, BP 63, ALGIERS 16340, ALGERIA.",10.1007/S12517-016-2490-Y,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY",,MOSTAGANEM UNIVERSITY (FACULTY OF SCIENCES AND TECHNOLOGY),,1866-7511,6,,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,9,2016,ISI000376611000029,49,GEOLOGY,6,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY",SAID.MAOUCHEGMAIL.COM,,DM8KH,,"MAOUCHE, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), CRAAG, BP 63, ALGIERS 16340, ALGERIA",ISI,FAC SCI AND TECHNOL,NOTREPORTED,,"SARDOU M, 2016, ARAB J GEOSCI","SARDOU M, 2016, ARAB J GEOSCI",FALSE,1,0,0,0,0,0,6_13_14,0,1

136,Nieland C;Mushtaq S,The effectiveness and need for flash flood warning systems in a regional inland city in australia,NATURAL HAZARDS,"The paper explores, from a householder's point of view, the effectiveness and need for an improved flood warning system in an inland regional city, toowoomba, which experienced a severe flash flood in january 2011. A survey was conducted across 75 households in four different areas in toowoomba. It investigated how many people received a warning about the flash flood, how they were warned, and their opinion of flood warning systems post-flood. The results show that no flash flood warning was issued and the local community was completely overwhelmed by the january 2011 flash flood event. Overall awareness of the risk of flash floods appeared to be quite high, especially following the january 2011 event, and the common opinion was that a flash flood warning system in toowoomba would be extremely useful. However, a level of uncertainty exists, particularly with regard to who should be responsible for providing flood warning systems. Education and home location in the risk areas are identified as important variables influencing opinion and awareness of flash flooding. Improved and coordinated information together with clear lines of responsibility for providing flood information, better lead time, and more reliable flood warning will greatly assist in future flood risk mitigation.",FLOOD WARNING; AWARENESS; HOUSEHOLDS; QUEENSLAND,RISK; RESPONSES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,5,"AEM (AUSTRALIAN EMERGENCY MANUAL), 2009, FLOOD WARNING MANUAL, V21.;BATES B.

Based on the importance of casualties linked to motor vehicles usage during flash flood noted in the literature, we worked on the hypothesis of a correlation between crisis period displacements and usual spatial practices. This study allowed distinguishing various types of behaviours in front of the flood progression.

This paper investigates the relationship between the rainfall hazard and the induced impact, as measured by impact indicators, and examines the effect of the social factor on the vulnerability of the system exposed to the flash flood risk. The study focuses on the catastrophic flash flood event that affected attica on october 22, 2015. The methodology includes the analysis of the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall and citizens' calls to the fire service emergency for help during the event, as well as the analysis of people's responses at an on-line behavioral survey.

On 16 december 2013, three days of heavy rain and a partial breaching of a succession of landslide dams triggered a debris flow and flash flood. One person died, nine homes were damaged, and 53 residents were evacuated. We asked villagers who were directly affected by that disaster about their knowledge of the hazard, in the hope of developing adaptation strategies. The survey showed that the majority of the villagers first became aware of the hazard during the 2013 disaster. Practical solutions exclude relocation because the village has stood in flow paths for the past 70 years or more, and because the families residing there are attached to the land and each other.

Many authors have noted that learning from historical disasters is a background process contributing to social resilience. In this study, three case studies examining multiple natural hazards, catastrophic landslides and flash floods in the study area of northern czechia are presented. The study of documentary data enabled us to reconstruct the social impacts of these hazards and the historical responses of communities to these impacts.

91,Okada T;Haynes K;Bird D;Van Den Honert R;King D,Recovery and resettlement following the 2011 flash flooding in the lockyer valley,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,"The lockyer valley region in southeast queensland. Australia experienced extreme flash flooding in january 2011 that resulted in the loss of 19 lives including 12 in the township of grantham. In order to reduce future risks, the lockyer valley regional council (lvrc) immediately committed to an innovative community resettlement project, despite an environment of political resistance and bureaucratic turmoil. From a local government perspective, this paper provides an overview and examination of the unique disaster recovery and resettlement process undertaken by the lvrc. A mixed methods approach was used to assess the resettlement project in terms of political, cultural, social and financial factors that act to sustain and improve people's lives and livelihoods. Methods included field observations, documentary analysis, focus group discussions and semistructured interviews with key lvrc officers. Integrating the interview data sets and a variety of source materials, this paper assesses the early-stage outcomes of the resettlement and recovery process in grantham and discusses the challenges and issues identified in the process so far. The paper addresses the significance of collaboration between all sectors involved including community members, governments, and land-use planning and emergency management practitioners. This research highlights the importance of community participation and the need for ongoing assessments in the resettlement and recovery process. (C) 2014 the authors. Published by elsevier ltd.

In-depth interviews were conducted with 33 of the original cohort of 120 post-disaster interviewees who experienced sudden traumatic bereavement and/or their own near-death experience. The data reveals that many of the survivors and rescuers were in worse-or far worse-situations than they had been in the weeks and months immediately after the disaster. Interviewees identified the worsening of their situation as being caused by systems failures by civil authorities, health care systems, welfare programmes and the insurance industry. Further research is recommended to assess the needs of people affected by natural disasters and the viability of a state-funded recovery scheme that could expedite personal, family and community recovery.

118,Hopkins J;Warburton J,"Local perception of infrequent, extreme upland flash flooding: prisoners of experience?",DISASTERS,"The united kingdom has experienced several exceptional summer flash floods in recent years and there is growing concern about the frequency of such events and the preparedness of the population. This paper uses a case study of the upper ryedale flash flood (2005) and questionnaire and interview data to assess local perceptions of upland flash flooding. Experience of a major flash flood may not be associated with increased flood risk perception. Despite local residents' awareness of a trend towards wetter summers and more frequent heavy rainfall, the poor maintenance of rivers was more frequently thought to be a more significant factor influencing local flood risk than climate change. Such findings have important implications for the potential success of contemporary national flood policies, which have put greater emphasis on public responsibility for responding to flooding. This study recommends, therefore, the use of fresh participatory approaches to redistribute and raise awareness of locally-held flood knowledge.",FLASH FLOOD; FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT; HAZARD PERCEPTION; HEAVY RAINFALL; UPPER RYEDALE FLASH FLOOD; UPLANDS,RISK PERCEPTION; CLIMATE-CHANGE; AWARENESS; VULNERABILITY; MANAGEMENT; TEMPERATE; HYDROLOGY; LESSONS; STRESS; PEOPLE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,9,"[ANONYMOUS], 2007, CUMBERLAND WEST 0720.;ARCHER DR, 2007, WATER ENVIRON J, V21, P133, DOI 10.1111/J.1747-6593.2006.00058.X.;BBC NEWS, 2012, BBC NEWS.;BBC NEWS, 2008, BBC NEWS.;BELL S., 2014, BBC NEWS.;BICKERSTAFF K, 2001, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V11, P133, DOI 10.1016/S0959-3780(00)00063-7.;BIRKHOLZ S, 2014, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V478, P12, DOI 10.1016/J.SCITOTENV.2014.01.061.;BORROWS P, 2006, IRRIG DRAIN, V55, PS133, DOI 10.1002/IRD.260.;BOTZEN WJW, 2009, WATER RESOUR RES, V45, DOI 10.1029/2009WR007743.;BOYCE C, 2006, CONDUCTING DEPTH INT.;BRADFORD RA, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P2299, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-2299-2012.;BROWN L., 2007, GAZETTE HERALD 0801.;BUBECK P, 2012, RISK ANAL, V32, P1481, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.2011.01783.X.;BUNYAN B., 2009, TELEGRAPH.;BURN DH, 1999, WATER RESOUR RES, V35, P3451, DOI 10.1029/1999WR900215.;BURNINGHAM K, 2008, DISASTERS, V32, P216, DOI 10.1111/J.0361-3666.2007.01036.X.;BURT S., 2005, WEATHER, V60, P219, DOI DOI 10.1256/WEA.26.05.;BURT TP, 2012, INT J CLIMATOL, V32, P518, DOI 10.1002/JOC.2287.;BURTON I, 1968, 1 U COL NAT HAZ RES.;BURTON I, 1993, ENV HAZARD.;CARLING PA, 1986, T I BRIT GEOGR, V11, P105, DOI 10.2307/622074.;CAVE B., 2009, SC070021 ENV AG.;COOPER I., 1887, HIST HELMSLEY RIEVAU.;CREUTIN JD, 2003, HYDROL PROCESS, V17, P1453, DOI 10.1002/HYP.5122.;CUTTER SL, 2003, SOC SCI QUART, V84, P242, DOI 10.1111/1540-6237.8402002.;CUTTER SL, 1996, PROG HUM GEOG, V20, P529, DOI 10.1177/030913259602000407.;DEFRA, 2005, MAK SPAC WAT TAK FOR.;DEPARTMENT FOR COMMUNITIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT, 2006, PLANN POL STAT 25 DE.;DUFTY N, 2008, AUST J EMERG MANAG, V23, P4.;ENVIRONMENT AGENCY, 2007, REV 2007 SUMM FLOODS.;ENVIRONMENT AGENCY, 2009, FLOOD ENGL NAT ASS F.;ENVIRONMENT AGENCY, 2010, OUS CATCHM FLOOD MAN.;ENVIRONMENT AGENCY AND DEFRA, 2011, UND RISKS EMP COMM B.;ENVIRONMENT FOOD AND RURAL AFFAIRS COMMITTEE, 2013, 3 ENV FOOD RUR AFF C, VI.;FERGUSON CJ, 2009, PROF PSYCHOL-RES PR, V40, P532, DOI 10.1037/A0015808.;FIELDING JL, 2012, DISASTERS, V36, P477, DOI 10.1111/J.1467-7717.2011.01270.X.;FREEMAN J.

The flash floods brought by washi resulted in a massive and unprecedented destruction of urban areas, causing, only in cagayan de oro, the displacement of 228,576 persons that represents almost 40\% of the total city population, 5,801 houses were totally destroyed and 12,635 were partially damaged. Approximately 85\% of the affected households were informal settlers of highly vulnerable and marginal areas located near the river banks. As a result, the post-disaster housing recovery projects focused on the resettlement of these communities as a priority for permanent housing. In the following month of the disaster, the government announced an ambitious resettlement project to build more than 8,500 houses in safer locations. The project implies a complex process in which each stakeholder has specific roles, responsibilities, and approaches. Therefore, the success of the project depends on a large extent of the relationships among stakeholders, leadership and the decisions taken independently by each stakeholder who in turn is affected by other stakeholders' decisions. This research examines the coordination mechanisms, criteria for decision making and the complex interactions among the different stakeholders involved in the housing reconstruction in cagayan de oro in the aftermath of washi for a better understanding of the process which is needed for an effective management of the resettlement projects.

204,Arlikatti S;Maghelal P;Agnimitra N;Chatterjee V,Should i stay or should i go? Mitigation strategies for flash flooding in india,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF DISASTER RISK REDUCTION,"Post-disaster rehabilitation and rebuilding efforts are oftentimes spearheaded by government agencies rather hastily, to meet the urgent demands of disaster survivors. However in the absence of pre-planning for disaster recovery, they may increase community vulnerabilities due to a break down in social ties and livelihood needs. There is a growing recognition that adhoc top down policies should be replaced with an understanding of the preferences and needs of disaster survivors. This research is aimed at gauging the intended mitigation strategies that survivors from the himalayan region of north india expressed, following the devastating flash flooding in 2013. A semi-structured questionnaire was used to interview 316 residents from 17 villages in the state of uttarakhand to measure demographic characteristics, risk perception, prior flash flood hazard experience, evacuation experience, damage to home, and intended structural (relocate/building back better) and non-structural (investing time and effort in emergency planning or raising self-awareness and knowledge of threats knowledge) mitigation measures. Findings suggest that relocation is not a preferred mitigation strategy. Rather, an overwhelming majority of the respondents are interested in emergency planning at the household and village levels. Investing in revising and updating the plans at all levels of government, reviewing the existing forecasting and warning system and creating a robust risk communication plan with local input, strictly enforcing the provisions of flood plain zoning act, 2012, improving hazard awareness programs and creating village level task forces with direct linkages to the state disaster management agency are some of the recommendations made.",MITIGATION; RELOCATION; BUILDING BACK BETTER; FLASH FLOODS UTTARAKHAND; INDIA; MOUNTAINOUS COMMUNITIES,VULNERABILITY; AFTERMATH; RECOVERY; DISASTER,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"ANDREW SA, 2013, J HOUS BUILT ENVIRON, V28, P17, DOI 10.1007/S10901-012-9266-9.;[ANONYMOUS], HINDUSTAN TIMES.;[ANONYMOUS], INDIAN EXPRESS.;ARLIKATTI S., 2017, COMING HOME DISASTER, P175.;ARLIKATTI S, 2012, NAT HAZARDS REV, V13, P34, DOI 10.1061/(ASCE)NH.1527-6996.0000062.;ASTHANA V., 2012, EC POLITICAL WKLY, VXLVII.;BARENSTEIN JD, 2010, BUILDING BACK BETTER, P163.;CENSUS OF INDIA CENSUS OF INDIA, 2011, PROV POP TOT UTT CEN.;DAS PK, 2013, IOSR J ENV SCI TOXIC, V7, P33, DOI DOI 10.9790/2402-0723345.;DIXIT A, 2003, NAT HAZARDS, V28, P155, DOI 10.1023/A:1021134218121.;GARDNER JS, 2007, NAT HAZARDS, V41, P317, DOI 10.1007/S11069-006-9038-5.;HALVORSON SJ, 2007, MT RES DEV, V27, P322, DOI 10.1659/MRD.0900.;HALVORSON SJ, 2010, DISASTERS, V34, P184, DOI [10.1111/J.1467-7717.2009.01124.X, 10.1111/J.0361-3666.2009.01124.X].;LIN SY, 2008, NAT HAZARDS, V44, P305, DOI 10.1007/S11069-007-9136-Z.;MONTZ B.E., 2002, ENV HAZARDS, V4, P1.;NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF DISASTER MANAGEMENT, UTT DIS 2013.;RAUTELA P, 2015, INT J DISAST RISK RE, V13, P281, DOI 10.1016/J.IJDRR.2015.07.004.;SCHAD I, 2012, NAT HAZARDS, V62, P221, DOI 10.1007/S11069-011-9992-4.;THE WORLD BANK (N.D.), 2017, P146653 WORLD BANK.","ARLIKATTI, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), RABDAN ACAD, FAC RESILIENCE, BUSINESS CONTINU MANAGEMENT \& INTEGRATED EMERGENCY, POB 114646, ABU DHABI, U ARAB EMIRATES.;ARLIKATTI, SUDHA, RABDAN ACAD, FAC RESILIENCE, BUSINESS CONTINU MANAGEMENT \& INTEGRATED EMERGENCY, POB 114646, ABU DHABI, U ARAB EMIRATES.;MAGHELAL, PRAVEEN, KHALIFA UNIV SCI \& TECHNOL, DEPT IND \& SYST ENGN, MI CAMPUS,POB 54224, ABU DHABI, U ARAB EMIRATES.;AGNIMITRA, NEERA, UNIV DELHI, DEPT SOCIAL WORK, DELHI SCH SOCIAL WORK, DELHI, INDIA.;CHATTERJEE, VASWATI, UNIV NORTH TEXAS, DEPT PUBL ADM, 410 AVE C,CHILTON HALL SUITE 204, DENTON, TX 76203 USA.",10.1016/J.IJDRR.2017.09.019,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,USA NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION (RAPID) [1361323],,2212-4209,,48-56,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,27,2018,ISI000419493400005,19,"GEOLOGY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",27,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",SARLIKATTIRA.AC.AE PMAGHELALMASDAR.AC.AE NEERAAGNIMITRAGMAIL.COM VASWATI.JUGMAIL.COM,,FS0WC,,"ARLIKATTI, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), RABDAN ACAD, FAC RESILIENCE, BUSINESS CONTINU MANAGEMENT \& INTEGRATED EMERGENCY, POB 114646, ABU DHABI, U ARAB EMIRATES",ISI,RABDAN ACAD;KHALIFA UNIV SCI AND TECHNOL;UNIV DELHI;UNIV NORTH TEXAS,RABDAN ACAD,,"ARLIKATTI S, 2018, INT J DISASTER RISK REDUCT","ARLIKATTI S, 2018, INT J DISASTER RISK REDUCT",FALSE,0,5_6,3,0,3,0,6_16,2,1
426,Moses T;Fishman P,Ashland creek - embracing human amenity needs in urban stream restoration design,PROTECTION AND RESTORATION OF URBAN AND RURAL STREAMS,"Severe damages due to flash flooding within a park and center of downtown ashland directly threatened the economic viability of the town, which is heavily dependent on tourism. It also impacted the quality of life for residents drawn to the considerable amenities offered by this small community. Park trails are heavily used by residents as well as visitors, and the calle guanajuato, where the creek is bordered by sidewalk cafes, is a special magnet for tourists. Although traditional environmental concerns were of great importance in the ``restoration of flood-damaged ashland creek, it was the recreational value of the creek and its importance to the area's economy that was of paramount importance. This fact is reflected in the unique approaches to urban creek corridor rehabilitation discussed here. This case study demonstrates some of the problems as well as design opportunities which arise when ``conventional thinking on stream restoration, which has generally been focused on fish in the pacific northwest, must contend with both the legacy effects of past impacts and the premium that many cities and towns now place on watercourses as recreational and visual assets for the community.",,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,,"MOSES, T (REPRINT AUTHOR), SKELLY \& LOY INC, ENVIRONM ENGN SERV GRP, 2601 N FRONT ST, HARRISBURG, PA 17110 USA.;SKELLY \& LOY INC, ENVIRONM ENGN SERV GRP, HARRISBURG, PA 17110 USA.",,"UNITED ENGINEERING CENTER, 345 E 47TH ST, NEW YORK, NY 10017-2398 USA","CLAR, M AND CARPENTER, D AND GRACIE, J AND SLATE, L",,0-7844-0695-2,,,91-100,AMER SOC CIVIL ENGINEERS,,2004,ISI000222180700009,0,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, WATER RESOURCES",5,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",,,BAH14,PROTECTION AND RESTORATION OF URBAN AND RURAL STREAMS,"MOSES, T (REPRINT AUTHOR), SKELLY \& LOY INC, ENVIRONM ENGN SERV GRP, 2601 N FRONT ST, HARRISBURG, PA 17110 USA",ISI,ENVIRONM ENGN SERV GRP,ENVIRONM ENGN SERV GRP,,"MOSES T, 2004, PROTECTION AND RESTORATION OF URBAN AND RURAL STREAMS","MOSES T, 2004, PROTECTION AND RESTORATION OF URBAN AND RURAL STREAMS",FALSE,1,6,1,0,0,2_6,6_16_15,1,1
294,Ryan B,Information seeking in a flood,DISASTER PREVENTION AND MANAGEMENT,"Purpose - the purpose of this paper is to address the gaps in knowledge about how people get information in a flood and what they want to know. Design/methodology/approach - a total of 27 people were interviewed from two communities that suffered flooding in the 12 months before the interviews. Slow-moving flood and flash flood were covered. Findings - the type of disaster determines how people seek information. In slow-moving flood, people heard from others, tracked it visually and via web-available river gauge information, and talked to others with more flood experience. Radio was an important confirmation tool in the slow-moving flood. In flash flood, people first heard from others and then turned to television. Research limitations/implications participants made up a small sample skewed toward regional areas and were selected by snowball/convenience sampling methods. A survey is required to confirm or refute findings. Practical implications - word of mouth needs to be tapped into by agencies, and mobile phone networks and social media are critical to this. Radio and television should be more proactively used by emergency agencies and maps should be a feature of all flood communication. Originality/value - the focus of disaster communication research tends to have been on agency use of communication rather than the individual's use of a range of communication channels. This study encourages agencies to look at how individuals look for information, the channels they use to get information and the type of information they seek.",FLOODS; RADIO; INFORMATION-SEEKING; INFORMATION SOURCE; SOCIAL MEDIA; COMMUNICATION; EMERGENCY; DISASTER,MEDIA; DISASTER; CONTEXT; CRISIS; COMMUNICATION; PREFERENCES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,15,"ALLIANCE STRATEGIC RESEARCH, 2011, SOCIAL MEDIA IN THE.;AMERICAN RED CROSS, 2011, SOCIAL MEDIA IN DISA.;AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS, 2007, 2006 CENSUS QUICHSTA.;AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS, 2010, NATIONAL REGIONAL PR.;AUSTRALIAN BUREAU OF STATISTICS, 2011, NATIONAL REGIONAL PR.;BARTON A.

527,Ha'apio Mo;Gonzalez R;Wairiu M,Is there any chance for the poor to cope with extreme environmental events? Two case studies in the solomon islands,WORLD DEVELOPMENT,"Our paper analyses the patterns and factors that explain households' responses to extreme environmental events (eees) in two case studies of indigenous communities in the solomon islands. We used the ethnographic approach to describe the case studies and carried out thematic analysis to disentangle the factors that explain such responses. The first case was that of a rural community from ranogha island in the western province that was hit by the tsunami of april 2007, the second was of a community settled in an informal development on a flood-prone area in peri-urban honiara that was hit by a flash flood in april 2014. Drawing from the villagers' experiences, we found that aid and support from family and community, referred to by the respondents as the ``wantok system, was key to recovering from the disasters. Many respondents identified climate change as one leading factor that explained such catastrophic events. The social cooperation system, the government's role in responding to catastrophes and household net worth were identified among the main components of household responses. These constitute an effective engine to build palliative and preventive responses against catastrophic events and climate change risks. In spite of the extreme poverty observed, and the lack of government assistance, we conclude that amenities obtained from the community (through the wantok system) and household net worth (including the availability of common pool resources) enabled them to cope with the catastrophes. These factors are critical for long-term adaptation to eees and climate change risks. The community responses analysed with thematic analysis showed to be consistent with the conceptualization led by a farm-household model, and the household net worth as a source of income appears to be the correct measure of wealth instead the level of income in these less monetarised communities. Learning from how these communities and households responded to such eees provides evidence on how other communities could successfully adapt to increasing climate change risks.

Focusing on migrations induced by flash floods in zhouqu and droughts in central ningxia, china this study illustrates key factors in the process of policy options to support climate-induced migration. The study is based on stakeholder interviews and secondary data processing. The findings show that integrating sudden and slow-onset hazards, combining top-down and bottom-up methodology and encouraging private sectors to establish public-private partnership, are the main policy options from disaster relief perspective. Otherwise, two prospective transformations are proposed in policy options, transferring from re-active migration to pro-active migration, and from move \& stay to hope \& development in the aspect of migrants' livelihood improvement.",MIGRATION; CLIMATE CHANGE; POLICY RESPONSE; SUDDEN DISASTER; SLOW-ONSET DISASTER,VULNERABILITY; FLOOD,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"AMENDOLA JLA, 2007, ENV HAZARDS, V7, P1.;BARNETT J, 2010, EARTHSCAN CLIM, P1.;BLACK R, 2008, DIFD WORKING PAPER.;CRUZ R.V., 2007, CLIMATE CHANGE 2007.;CUI P, 2011, NAT HAZARDS, V56, P19, DOI 10.1007/S11069-009-9392-1.;DE WET C, 2005, IMPROVING OUTCOMES D.;DIXIT A, 2003, NAT HAZARDS, V28, P155, DOI 10.1023/A:1021134218121.;ISDR-INTERNATIONAL RECOVERY PLATFORM (IRP), 2007, LEARN DIS REC GUID D.;JAGER J, 2009, EACH FOR SYNTHESIS R.;JONSSON G., 2010, WORKING PAPERS INT M, V21.;KLINE DS, 2003, J NURS SCHOLARSHIP, V35, P107, DOI 10.1111/J.1547-5069.2003.00107.X.;LIU C, 2011, GEOL B CHINA, V20, P141.;LIU CL, 2008, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V18, P543, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2008.09.002.;LUO QIANGQIANG, 2009, RESEARCH OF AGRICULTURAL MODERNIZATION, V30, P575.;MCLEMAN R, 2010, POPUL ENVIRON, V31, P286, DOI 10.1007/S11111-009-0087-Z.;MEA, 2005, EC HUM WELL BEING DE.;MEZE-HAUSKEN E., 2000, MITIG ADAPT STRAT GL, V5, P379, DOI DOI 10.1023/A:1026570529614.;OLIVER-SMITH A, 1977, AM ETHNOL, V4, P102, DOI [10.1525/AE.1977.4.1.02A00060, DOI 10.1525/AE.1977.4.1.02A00060].;OSTWALD M., 2006, LAND USE POLICY, V23, P361, DOI 10.1016/J.LANDUSEPOL.2005.04.004.;PIGUET E, 2008, NEW ISSUES REFUGEE R.;POPOVSKI V, 2012, SUSTAIN SCI, V7, P5, DOI 10.1007/S11625-011-0138-0.;QIN DH, 2006, J CLIMATE, V19, P1820, DOI 10.1175/JCLI3694.1.;RENAUD FG, 2007, UNU DESERTIFICATION, V7, P24.;SHI P, 2011, ATLAS NATURAL DISAST.;SMIT B, 2006, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V16, P282, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2006.03.008.;SUN J, 2011, AGR SCI TECHNOL, V11, P11.;WANG J, 2006, TEMPORAL SPATIAL PAT.;WARNER K, 2010, NAT HAZARDS, V55, P689, DOI 10.1007/S11069-009-9419-7.;XU ZG, 2006, WORLD DEV, V34, P130, DOI 10.1016/J.WORLDDEV.2005.08.002.;ZHOU HJ, 2010, NAT HAZARDS, V53, P21, DOI 10.1007/S11069-009-9407-Y.;ZHOU JK, 2011, FRONT ECON CHINA, V6, P592, DOI 10.1007/S11459-011-0149-X.;ZONG YQ, 2000, NAT HAZARDS, V22, P165, DOI 10.1023/A:1008119805106.;ZOU M, 2011, INTEGRATED RISK GOVE.","ZHOU, HJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), MINIST CIVIL AFFAIRS, NATL DISASTER REDUCT CTR CHINA, 6 GUANGBAIDONGLU, BEIJING 100124, PEOPLES R CHINA.;ZHOU, HONGJIAN, YUAN, YI, MINIST CIVIL AFFAIRS, NATL DISASTER REDUCT CTR CHINA, BEIJING 100124, PEOPLES R CHINA.;ZHANG, WEIXING, BEIJING NORMAL UNIV, ACAD DISASTER REDUCT \& EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT, BEIJING 100875, PEOPLES R CHINA.;SUN, YEHONG, BEIJING UNION UNIV, INST TOURISM, BEIJING 100101, PEOPLES R CHINA.",10.1007/S11027-012-9438-7,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,"NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [41201553, 41201580, 41171402]; INTERNATIONAL PROJECT OF ``GEF-FAO/GIAHS CONSERVATION AND ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT; ADAPTING TO CLIMATE CHANGE IN CHINA (ACCC) PROJECT; UK DEPARTMENT FOR INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT; SWISS AGENCY FOR DEVELOPMENT CO-OPERATION; UK DEPARTMENT FOR ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE",,1381-2386,4,375-389,SPRINGER,19,2014,ISI000333389600001,33,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY,29,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES,ZHOUHJ\_BNUHOTMAIL.COM SUNYEHONGBUU.EDU.CN,,AD6RW,,"ZHOU, HJ (REPRINT AUTHOR), MINIST CIVIL AFFAIRS, NATL DISASTER REDUCT CTR CHINA, 6 GUANGBAIDONGLU, BEIJING 100124, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,NATL DISASTER REDUCT CTR CHINA;BEIJING NORMAL UNIV;BEIJING UNION UNIV,NATL DISASTER REDUCT CTR CHINA,,"ZHOU H, 2014, MITIG ADAPT STRATEG GLOB CHANG","ZHOU H, 2014, MITIG ADAPT STRATEG GLOB CHANG",FALSE,0,4,0,0,0,0,6_8,0,1

Regardless of the above, few scientists have tackled up to now the integration of rc into flood risk management. In this connection, this particular study seeks to check out the potential of a risk dialogue approach (based on an ad hoc rc strategy) to change attitudes and behaviours in relation to flash flood risk. Via a pre-post survey design, we evaluated risk perception and awareness regarding a civil protection plan (cpp) implemented locally (i.e., in the municipality of navaluenga, central spain). For this particular objective, a questionnaire survey was created, and 201 adults (representing more than 10\% of the population census) were interviewed twice in a one-year period. Before the second survey, an rc strategy was created. The rc strategy comprised briefings, quiz answers, storytelling, a contest of videos and photographs about past floods, and an intergenerational workshop. A t-test for paired sample analyses and a general linear model (glm) repeated measures anova were applied to identify changes in risk perception and awareness. Our results indicate that the rc strategy did increase flood risk perception in navaluenga in the long term (lifetime). Also, it increased the level of awareness of the various features that comprise the cpp, enabling people to be more competent in facing a flash flood. Some cognitive biases detected in the perceptual process of human beings may shed some light on the results obtained. The implementation of well-thought-out rc strategies can play a role in improving resilience, particularly in geographic areas such as the iberian peninsula, in which climate change scenarios indicate a likely increase in the severity and frequency of flooding.",EU FLOOD DIRECTIVE; FLOOD RISK; FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT; URBAN AREA; SOCIAL RESILIENCE; RISK COMMUNICATION,SOCIAL PERCEPTIONS; MANAGEMENT; UNCERTAINTY; RETHINKING; CHALLENGES; STRATEGIES; EUROPE; MODELS; CITIES; BIAS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,5,none,"BODOQUE, JM (REPRINT AUTHOR), UNIV CASTILLA LA MANCHA, DEPT MIN \& GEOL ENGN, TOLEDO, SPAIN.;BODOQUE, J.

Understanding the role played by predictions in flood events can help forecasters provide more useful information, and it can help decision makers use this information more effectively as part of broader flood loss-reduction strategies. This article examines the interactions among predictions, decisions, and flood-related outcomes by analyzing three cases of severe flooding in the united states: the red river basin flood of april 1997 in grand forks and fargo, n. D., the fort collins, colo. Flood in july 1997, and the pescadero creek basin, california flood in february 1998. The floods occurred in different hydrometeorological and societal circumstances, had different types of predictive information available, and had different societal impacts, providing an opportunity to compare and contrast lessons learned.

The purpose of this study is to highlight the response functions that should be undertaken when such disasters strike. Methods: secondary data, such as documents, organizational reports, and forms completed during response to the flood visits, were the methods of data collection in this study. Then, collected data were analyzed according to the response functions to disasters. Results: the study found that a strong disaster response function was the early warning system, by the iran meteorological organization, announced 1 week before the flood. Weaker functions were the lack of coordination among response organizations and the lack of a safety officer in the incident command system structure during the flash flood. Conclusions: the list of the disaster response functions identified by this study should aid the decision makers and first responders in facing natural or man-made disasters and enable them to better prepare for response functions in the future disasters.",FLASH FLOOD; RESPONSE; DISASTERS,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"FATEMI, F (REPRINT AUTHOR), SEMNAN UNIV MED SCI, RES CTR HLTH SCI \& TECHNOL, SEMNAN, IRAN.;DIZAJI, REZA ABBASZADEH, ARDALAN, ALI, UNIV TEHRAN MED SCI, SCH PUBL HLTH, DEPT DISASTER \& EMERGENCY HLTH, TEHRAN, IRAN.;ARDALAN, ALI, HARVARD UNIV, HARVARD HUMANITARIAN INITIAT, CAMBRIDGE, MA 02138 USA.;FATEMI, FARIN, SEMNAN UNIV MED SCI, RES CTR HLTH SCI \& TECHNOL, SEMNAN, IRAN.",10.1017/DMP.2018.94,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",,,,1935-7893,56,842-844,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,13,2019,ISI000505082200004,11,"PUBLIC, ENVIRONMENTAL \& OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH",0,"PUBLIC, ENVIRONMENTAL \& OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH",F-FATEMIALUMNUS.TUMS.AC.IR,,JZ4OS,,"FATEMI, F (REPRINT AUTHOR), SEMNAN UNIV MED SCI, RES CTR HLTH SCI \& TECHNOL, SEMNAN, IRAN",ISI,UNIV TEHRAN MED SCI;HARVARD UNIV;SEMNAN UNIV MED SCI,SEMNAN UNIV MED SCI,,"DIZAJI RA, 2019, DIS MED PUBLIC HEALTH PREP","DIZAJI RA, 2019, DIS MED PUBLIC HEALTH PREP",TRUE,0,0,0,2,2,0,6_8_16,0,2
30,Vinet F;Lumbroso D;Defossez S;Boissier L,A comparative analysis of the loss of life during two recent floods in france: the sea surge caused by the storm xynthia and the flash flood in var,NATURAL HAZARDS,"This paper aims to analyse and compare the loss of life that occurred during two recent floods in france. The first flood was due to a sea surge triggered by the storm called xynthia that hit the atlantic coast on 28 february 2010 (41 flood-related deaths). The second was a flash flood that struck the var department in the french mediterranean region on 15 june 2010 (26 fatalities). After detailing the assumptions and expected outcomes of the study of disaster-related fatalities, the paper focuses on the characteristics of the victims and the circumstances of their deaths. In the first case, 71\% of the victims were people aged over 60 (mainly women) who were surprised while they were sleeping and who died in or near their homes. In the case of the flash flood, the profiles of the victims were diverse as the flooding occurred in the afternoon and many people were trapped in open. The paper also highlights the factors that explain mortality. Physical factors such as water depth were determined. The relationship between the water depth and the age of victims was found to be relevant. In the case of the storm surge xynthia, the correlation between age and water depth is positive. For the flash flood, the correlation between age and water depth was negative as male adults died in open. In the first case, the vulnerability of people was closely linked to human features such as type of housing and age that people are not directly responsible for. During flash floods, dangerous behaviour by people highlighted the role of risk-taking in loss of life. We also examined the particular case of the deaths of the children. The paper concludes by discussing the factors of vulnerability on frail population such as elderly people or marginalized. The lack of risk awareness and crisis preparedness were clearly a major factor of vulnerability.",HUMAN VULNERABILITY; FLASH FLOOD; STORM SURGE; FLOOD-RELATED FATALITIES; PREVENTION; DIKES,HEALTH; FATALITIES; ENGLAND; KATRINA; HOME,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,35,"AHERN M, 2005, EPIDEMIOL REV, V27, P36, DOI 10.1093/EPIREV/MXI004.;ANTOINE J-M., 2001, ANN GEOGR, V110, P597.;ARTIGUE G, 2010, EPISODE PLUVIO ORAGE.;ASHLEY ST, 2008, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V47, P805, DOI 10.1175/2007JAMC1611.1.;ASSEMBLEE NATIONALE, 2010, RAPP INF RAIS DEGATS.;BALESTE MC, 2001, TEMPETES EXCEPTIONNE.;BOISSIER L, 2009, ACT 22 C ASS INT CLI.;BRGM, 2010, TEMP XYNTH COMP REND.;CARROLL B, 2009, HEALTH PLACE, V15, P540, DOI 10.1016/J.HEALTHPLACE.2008.08.009.;COATES L, 1999, AUST GEOGR, V30, P391, DOI 10.1080/00049189993657.;DE BRUIJN KM, 2009, J FLOOD RISK MANAG, V2, P58, DOI 10.1111/J.1753-318X.2009.01022.X.;DOMERGUE R, 1998, ELEVES IYCEE MONTAUR.;DOSA DM, 2007, J AM MED DIR ASSOC, V8, P142, DOI 10.1016/J.JAMDA.2006.11.004.;FERNANDEZ LAUREN S, 2002, PREHOSP DISASTER MED, V17, P67.;FEW R, 2004, 63 TYND CTR.;FLORES AQ, 2010, SURVIVING DISASTERS.;FRENCH J, 1983, PUBLIC HEALTH REP, V98, P584.;GARNIER E, 2010, CRISE XYNTHIA AUNE H.;GRUNTFEST E, 2001, NATO SCI SERIES.;HENSON R, 2001, NATO SCI SERIES.;HOYOIS P., 2005, FLOOD DISASTERS EURO.;HUBERT G, 2005, RISQUE INONDATION CA.;JONKMAN SN, 2008, J AM WATER RESOUR AS, V44, P1208, DOI 10.1111/J.1752-1688.2008.00217.X.;JONKMAN SN, 2009, RISK ANAL, V29, P676, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.2008.01190.X.;JONKMAN SN, 2005, DISASTERS, V29, P75, DOI 10.1111/J.0361-3666.2005.00275.X.;JONKMAN SN, 2007, THESIS DELFT U.;KELLER RC, 2010, NAT HAZARDS OBS, V35, P10.;KELMAN I, 2007, FLOOD RISK MANAGEMEN.;KELMAN I, 2004, FLOODRISKNET NEWSLET, V1, P3.;LEDOUX B., 2006, GESTION RISQUE INOND.;MARSHALL I., 2010, J AGING EMERG EC, V2, P79.;MEDDTL, 2010, TEMP XYNTH RET EXP E.;MEDDTL, 2010, RET EXP IN SURV DEP.;MISSION LITTORALE, 2005, CAB LITT LANG ROUSS.;MOONEY LE, 1983, 5 C HYDR, P127.;PARKER D.

338,Kabra G;Ramesh A,An empirical investigation of the enablers in humanitarian supply chain management in india a case study,JOURNAL OF ADVANCES IN MANAGEMENT RESEARCH,"Purpose - the purpose of this paper is to empirically analyze the perception of stakeholders, i. E. Disaster victims, volunteers and managers, who were involved in relief activities, toward the enablers in humanitarian supply chain management (hscm) with special emphasis on heart wrenching and deadliest disaster, that occurred in the uttarakhand (a northern state in india) on june 14, 2013. Design/methodology/approach - a detailed case study of the recently disaster, that occurred in the uttarakhand has been carried out to investigate the enablers associated with the hscm and the data were collected from published literature and newspaper articles, semi-structured interviews with academic experts and practitioners, hypothesis were formulated and tested using analysis of variance. Findings - the findings of the study indicate that, there is no significant difference in the perception of disaster victims, volunteers and managers toward the enablers in hscm in india. There is a strong need for more effective and efficient monitoring of over-exploitation of the mountainous regions, geographic information systems mapping of the state and a separate disaster communication network. Research limitations/implications - the scope of study is limited to flash floods that occurred in the uttarakhand. Extending the research on other types of disaster could be considered as the scope for further research. Practical implications - the paper investigates some of the enablers of hscm and discusses some of the emerging issues and lessons learned from the disaster that occurred in the uttarakhand, in managing future disasters in india and the other world. Originality/value - this paper presents the first attempt in india with its combination of field-based qualitative research and survey analysis to investigate the enablers of hscm in india.",INFORMATION MANAGEMENT; NATURAL HAZARDS; INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY; HUMANITARIAN SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT; ENABLER,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,5,"AGOSTINHO F., 2013, 6 IFAC C MANAGEMENT, V6, P206.;BALCIK B, 2010, INT J PROD ECON, V126, P22, DOI 10.1016/J.IJPE.2009.09.008.;BEYNON-DAVIS P., 2009, BUSINESS INFORM SYST.;CATE F.

238,Ryan B,A model to explain information seeking behaviour by individuals in the response phase of a disaster,LIBRARY \& INFORMATION SCIENCE RESEARCH,"This australian study establishes a model that provides a foundation for communication channels and tools selection by agencies in the post-warning response phase of a disaster. The model, developed from disaster and information seeking literature, attempts to predict information source and channel selection by people after their community has received a warning for a disaster. It provides the coding framework for analysis of 51 semi structured interviews with disaster-affected australians. The interviews tested the model for accommodation of channels and sources that people chose, found most useful, and used most in bushfire, slow flood, flash flood, and cyclone situations. The order of initial sources was investigated and preliminary information seeking pathways established across disaster types. The disaster information seeking model supports this investigation of information seeking behaviour, though improvements are suggested. The resulting model could guide agency response communication for different disaster types.",,SOURCE PREFERENCES; COMMUNICATION; RISK; PREPAREDNESS; PERCEPTION; COMMUNITY; WARNINGS; CONTEXT; PEOPLE; CRISIS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,"AUSTIN L, 2012, J APPL COMMUN RES, V40, P188, DOI 10.1080/00909882.2012.654498.;BARTON A., 1970, COMMUNITIES DISASTER.;BERRY P., 2010, SYDNEY MORNING HERAL.;BINNIE K., 2010, ABC NEWS.;BLAKE S., 2004, P INT S HUM BEH FIR, V3.;BOYLAN J., 2013, PRELIMINARY REPORT J.;BRACKEN CC, 2005, COMMUN RES REP, V22, P47, DOI 10.1080/0882409052000343516.;BRAUN V., 2006, QUALITATIVE RES PSYC, V3, P77, DOI DOI 10.1191/1478088706QP0630A.;BURGER J, 2013, J TOXICOL ENV HEAL A, V76, P1138, DOI 10.1080/15287394.2013.844087.;CARR LJ, 1932, AM J SOCIOL, V38, P207, DOI 10.1086/216030.;CASE DO, 2008, LIBR INFORM SCI SER, P1.;CHANEY P.

1,Rajesh S;Jain S;Sharma P,"Inherent vulnerability assessment of rural households based on socio-economic indicators using categorical principal component analysis: a case study of kimsar region, uttarakhand",ECOLOGICAL INDICATORS,"The recent trend of shifting focus from hazard centric drivers of vulnerability towards the social and economic drivers of vulnerability has led to a number of conceptual frameworks for social vulnerability assessment. Contributing towards this growing trend of social vulnerability assessment, this study proposes a framework to measure inherent vulnerability, which is centered on hazard generic and livelihood oriented socioeconomic factors of vulnerability. Inherent vulnerability is defined as the predisposition of a household to suffer harm. The study focuses on the mountainous communities in kimsar region, located in uttarakhand state, india. The communities in the region suffer from multiple stressors including extreme precipitation, drought, landslides, cloudbursts and flash floods. Vulnerability indicators with mixed scaling are used, to capture household's perception and other socio-economic attributes, which contribute towards its inherent vulnerability. Data was collected by conducting household surveys in nine villages of kimsar region. In order to process the indicators with mixed scaling, and obtain an empirical summary of the data set, the method of non-linear principal component analysis was used for computing a household level inherent vulnerability index. Results obtained revealed that principal components explaining a major variance in the data set were access to employment opportunities, effectiveness of local government, access to food, occupational diversity, access to resources, educational attainment and access to water. It was observed that the villages of dharkot, kandakhal and bhumiyakisar have the highest percentage of households, which were relatively less vulnerable to environmental stressors. Higher vulnerability was observed in majority of households in the village kimsar, ramjeewala and malls banas. A majority of households in talla banas, jogiyana and kasan were moderately vulnerable. Inherent vulnerability assessment has the potential to predict the future harm a household might suffer due to hazard events.",HAZARD GENERIC VULNERABILITY; CATEGORICAL PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS ANALYSIS; ACCESS TO RESOURCES; VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT; CLUSTER ANALYSIS,CLIMATE-CHANGE VULNERABILITY; SOCIAL VULNERABILITY; COMMUNITIES; INDEX; ADAPTATION; HEALTH; IMPACTS; HAZARDS; POLICY; STATES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,4,"ABDI H., 2003, ENCY SOCIAL SCI RES.;ADGER WN, 2006, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V16, P268, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2006.02.006.;ALAM GMM, 2017, ECOL INDIC, V72, P23, DOI [10.1016/J.ECOLIND.7.016.06.045, 10.1016/J.ECOLIND.2016.06.045].;ANTONY GM, 2007, PUBLIC HEALTH, V121, P578, DOI 10.1016/J.PUHE.2006.10.018.;ATAPATTU S., 2015, HUMAN RIGHTS APPROAC.;BLAIKIE P, 1994, RISK NATURAL HAZARDS.;BRETARI E., 2007, STAT APPL, VV, P53.;BREWER CA, 2002, ANN ASSOC AM GEOGR, V92, P662, DOI 10.1111/1467-8306.00310.;BROOKS N, 2005, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V15, P151, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2004.12.006.;BURGHELEA CI, 2011, J ENVIRON MONITOR, V13, P1308, DOI 10.1039/C1EM10016E.;CHEN WF, 2013, INT J DISAST RISK SC, V4, P169, DOI 10.1007/S13753-013-0018-6.;CONNOR R, 2015, UN WORLD WATER DEV R, V1.;COSTANTINI P, 2010, APPL STOCH MODEL BUS, V26, P85, DOI 10.1002/ASMB.771.;CROSS K., 2006, IISD WORKSH.;CUTTER SL, 2003, SOC SCI QUART, V84, P242, DOI 10.1111/1540-6237.8402002.;DERESSA TT, 2009, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V19, P248, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2009.01.002.;DOSSA LH, 2011, LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN, V102, P197, DOI 10.1016/J.LANDURBPLAN.2011.04.005.;DUMENU WK, 2016, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V55, P208, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2015.10.010.;DWYER A, 2004, GEOSCI AUST REC.;GAITHER CJ, 2011, FOREST POLICY ECON, V13, P24, DOI 10.1016/J.FORPOL.2010.07.009.;GALLOPIN GC, 2006, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V16, P293, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2006.02.004.;GAVRIS A.

203,Horn F;Elagib Na,Building socio-hydrological resilient cities against flash floods: key challenges and a practical plan for arid regions,JOURNAL OF HYDROLOGY,"The objective of this research is to improve the understanding and recognition of the management challenges to flash flooding hazards and the potential adaptive measures within the arid urban areas through a socio-hydrological framework. Considering the capital of sudan, khartoum, as an example of urban arid areas with increasing flash flood risk, the analysis was founded on expert views and opinions collected from a range of different flood management actors following the 2013 and 2014 flash flood events. The qualitative research methods included participant observation, expert interviews and focus groups. The main themes of management challenges recorded included weak institutional capacity, bad governance, limited resources, and poor urban planning. These four themes, in turn, included different types of challenges, among which lack of: civil society engagement and coordination of actors, political will, data and tools, and effective urban development strategy shared the highest number of comments from the professional actors in each theme, respectively. These findings presented a management perspective to the lessons previously established and learned from an impact assessment. Accordingly, the amalgamation of all the lessons learned from the flood research findings enabled a suitable master flash flood management plan (maffmap) to be proposed as a final product. This plan would operate within an integrated flash flood management (iffm) framework. The facets of the maffmap include steps toward improving the quantity and quality of data resources regarding this hazard, aspects for use of these new datasets within a mixed-measure (structural and non-structural) approach from the authorities, and programmes for building community and civil society capacity through improving awareness and engagement. Furthermore, it is intended that this plan would be a replicable design, which could therefore be adopted and implemented in the wider context of the urban arid regions.",URBAN FLASH FLOOD; INTEGRATED FLASH FLOOD MANAGEMENT; MANAGEMENT CHALLENGES; SOCIO-HYDROLOGY; RESILIENCE; SUDAN,CLIMATE-CHANGE; RAINFALL; RISK; SAHEL,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"BABIKER A., 1982, GEOJOURNAL, V6, P69.;BAJRACHARYA SR, 2017, J FLOOD RISK MANAG, V10, P5, DOI 10.1111/JFR3.12133.;BANNAGA S.

Rescue operations were carried out without situational awareness due to phone and cellular line failure and civil protection plan deficiency. Relief operations were carried out to recover to previous state with no lesson learned analysis nor legislative upgrade. A window of opportunity opened to fulfill the disaster management cycle theory. On october/november 2011, when a wider event struck both tuscany and liguria regions causing 12 fatalities, the situation was, more or less, the same as the past year: the window of opportunity closed without a reduction in risk exposure. After this last event ligurian region administration started to re- evaluate hazard mapping and risk assessment methodologies, since debris floods were not considered in official hazard maps and urban planning regulations. But a month later, the temporary building restrictions were reformed to low strict level. Different to northwest italy extensive floods of 1994, that led italy to a new approach to hazard planning and risk evaluation, liguria 2010/2011 events did not to seemingly involve, bureaucracy and civil society on the new resilience concept and on the use of the emerging technologies and social media.",MEDITERRANEAN RAINSTORM; CRISIS MANAGEMENT; DISASTER RISK REDUCTION; RESILIENCE; WEB 2.0,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,"ADGER W.

162,Esposito G;Matano F;Scepi G,"Analysis of increasing flash flood frequency in the densely urbanized coastline of the campi flegrei volcanic area, italy",FRONTIERS IN EARTH SCIENCE,"Climate change is affecting the frequency and severity of extreme meteorological and geo-hydrological events hitting the coastal zone of the campi flegrei volcanic district (southern italy), which is prone to a wide spectrum of natural hazards, including volcanism, earthquakes, ground deformation, flash floods, landslides, and coastal erosion. This study documents the trend of flash floods affecting the town of pozzuoli, located along the coastline of the campi flegrei volcanic area, during the 1970-2014 time period. An archive research together with the collection of data published on news websites and social media allowed understanding of the triggering and evolution mechanisms of flash floods in the area, as well as the most recurrent damages. Rainfall data collected by the rain gauge located within the pozzuoli watershed were also analyzed. Results of this study show an increased frequency of flash flood events occurred in the study area. The variation in flash flood frequency is likely not related to urbanization changes, as no increase of the urban area occurred after the year 2000. The observed increase of flash flood events in recent years (2000-2014) can be reasonably ascribed to variations in the rainfall regime. Our research provides a contribution for the understanding of flash flood processes in the study area as well as relevant information for hazard and risk assessment.",CLIMATE CHANGE; FLASH FLOOD; EXTREME PRECIPITATIONS; POZZUOLI; ITALY,MEDITERRANEAN REGION; SOVERATO FLOOD; SOCIAL MEDIA; PRECIPITATION; CAMPANIA; LANDSLIDES; DEPOSITS; DATABASE; EVENTS; TRENDS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,"ARONICA GT, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P1295, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-1295-2012.;BENEDUCE P, 1988, MEM SOC GEOL ITAL, V41, P949.;BLOSCHL G, 2017, SCIENCE, V357, P588, DOI 10.1126/SCIENCE.AAN2506.;BROCCA L, 2011, REMOTE SENS ENVIRON, V115, P3390, DOI 10.1016/J.RSE.2011.08.003.;BROUWER T, 2017, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V17, P735, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-17-735-2017.;BRUNETTI M, 2004, J GEOPHYS RES-ATMOS, V109, DOI 10.1029/2003JD004296.;CALCATERRA D., 2003, P INT C CITTAM 2003, P524.;LLASAT MC, 2016, J HYDROL, V541, P24, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2016.05.040.;CASCINI L, 2014, LANDSLIDES, V11, P779, DOI 10.1007/S10346-013-0395-3.;CEVASCO A, 2012, RENDICONTI ONLINE SO, V21, P384.;CHANDLER T.J, 1965, CLIMATE LONDON.;DE CHIARA G, 2016, VOLCANIC ROCKS AND SOILS, P165.;DE LUCA C., 2010, P INT WORKSH ADV STA, P1.;DE VITA P, 2013, LANDSLIDES, V10, P713, DOI 10.1007/S10346-012-0348-2.;DI MARTIRE D, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P905, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-905-2012.;DI VITO MA, 1999, J VOLCANOL GEOTH RES, V91, P221, DOI 10.1016/S0377-0273(99)00037-2.;DIAKAKIS M, 2014, J FLOOD RISK MANAG, V7, P332, DOI 10.1111/JFR3.12053.;DIAKAKIS M., 2016, B GEOL SOC GR, V50, P681, DOI [10.12681/BGSG.11774, DOI 10.12681/BGSG.11774].;DORIGO WA, 2011, HYDROL EARTH SYST SC, V15, P1675, DOI 10.5194/HESS-15-1675-2011.;DUCROCQ V, 2014, B AM METEOROL SOC, V95, P1083, DOI 10.1175/BAMS-D-12-00244.1.;ESPOSITO G., 2015, REND ONLINE SOC GEOL, V34, P74, DOI DOI 10.3301/IJG.2015.41.;ESPOSITO G, 2017, CATENA, V152, P227, DOI 10.1016/J.CATENA.2017.01.009.;FACCINI F, 2015, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V15, P2631, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-15-2631-2015.;FEDERICO S, 2003, NUOVO CIMENTO C, V26, P7.;FINLEY J.P., 1884, AM METEOR J, V1, P85.;FRATTINI P, 2010, ENG GEOL, V111, P62, DOI 10.1016/J.ENGGEO.2009.12.004.;GARIANO SL, 2017, SCI TOTAL ENVIRON, V596, P417, DOI 10.1016/J.SCITOTENV.2017.03.103.;GAUME E., 2016, HYDROMETEOROLOGICAL, P133.;GRECO R, 2013, HYDROL EARTH SYST SC, V17, P4001, DOI 10.5194/HESS-17-4001-2013.;GUZZETTI F, 1994, ENVIRON MANAGE, V18, P623, DOI 10.1007/BF02400865.;HANSSEN A.

365,Raska P;Dostal P,Evolution of disaster relief law under multiple transformations: progressive learning or walking in a circle?,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& POLICY,"The aim of this paper is to examine the association between double-loop disaster learning and transformations of political systems. The particular question is how disasters increase the rapidity and complexity, with which the transforming regimes face the unsuitability and inadequacy of the past forms and processes of disaster governance. The centennial evolution of the disaster relief law at a country scale (czech republic, resp. Czechoslovakia, 1918-present) is used as an example. The thorough search in digital repository of czech and slovak parliamentary library was performed to obtain legislative norms and protocols from parliamentary debates, whereas major disasters that induced new laws (1927 flash flood, 1947 drought, 1997 and 2002 floods) were identified from existing databases and from detailed reconstructions of historical disastrous events. The described cases enabled to add new empirical evidence contesting (i) the process scheme of disaster politics during critical junctures and institutional transformations, and (ii) the progressive nature of the double-loop learning approach related to disasters. It is shown that the double-loop learning from disasters and its benefits should be considered as time-dependent and related to permissive and productive conditions that facilitated the adoption of the new disaster relief law(i.e. The learning process). Finally, the implications for the research agenda (historical disaster research) and for disaster policy (evaluation of disaster relief effectiveness) are summarized.",DISASTER RELIEF; LEGISLATION; SOCIETAL TRANSFORMATION; DOUBLE-LOOP LEARNING,ADAPTATION; RESILIENCE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"BARREDO JI, 2007, NAT HAZARDS, V42, P125, DOI 10.1007/S11069-006-9065-2.;BATESON G., 1972, STEPS ECOLOGY MIND C.;BRAZDIL R, 2009, THEOR APPL CLIMATOL, V97, P297, DOI 10.1007/S00704-008-0065-X.;BRAZDIL R., 2005, HIST RECENT FLOODS C.;BRAZDIL R, 2016, CLIM RES, V70, P161, DOI 10.3354/CR01387.;CHOULARTON R, 2001, SAFETY SCI, V39, P61, DOI 10.1016/S0925-7535(01)00026-1.;DIETZSCHOLD G., 1928, Z ANGEW METEOROLOGIE, V45, P105.;DILLEY M, 2016, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V61, P74, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2016.04.002.;DOSTAL P, 1998, ENVIRON PLANN C, V16, P281, DOI 10.1068/C160281.;DOSTAL P., 1992, CHANGING TERRITORIAL, P17.;DRURY A.

In 2017, a flash flood event occurred in the same area affected by the gorkha earthquake and aggravated the damage to structures and lifelines. The present paper reports the damage of structures and lifelines subjected to multi-hazards in the affected area in central nepal. Field investigations were performed after the gorkha earthquake as well as the 2017 chhatiune khola flash flood. Specifically, damage associated with bridges, vernacular stone masonry buildings, roads, water supply systems, irrigation canals, electric poles, and road signs was assessed. Field measurement in terms of flow height was recorded in the case of vernacular buildings, and depth-damage curve due to the flash flood is depicted in this study.

16,Carmen Llasat M;Marcos R;Llasat-Botija M;Gilabert J;Turco M;Quintana-Segui P,Flash flood evolution in north-western mediterranean,ATMOSPHERIC RESEARCH,"The present paper shows an in-depth analysis of the evolution of floods and precipitation in catalonia for the period 1981-2010. In order to have homogeneous information, and having in mind that not gauge data was available for all the events, neither for all the rivers and stream flows, daily press from a specific newspaper has been systematically analysed for this period. Furthermore a comparison with a longer period starting in 1900 has been done. 219 flood events (mainly flash flood events) have been identified for the period of 30 years (375 starting in 1900), 79 of them were ordinary, 117 of them were extraordinary and 23 of them were catastrophic, being autumn and summer the seasons with the maxima values. 19\% of the events caused a total of 110 casualties. 60\% of them died when they tried to cross the street or the stream. Factors like the evolution of precipitation, population density and other socio-economical aspects have been considered. The trend analysis shows an increase of 1 flood/decade that probably has been mainly due to inter-annual and intra-annual changes in population density and in land-use and land-cover.

205,Leal M;Ramos C;Pereira S,Different types of flooding lead to different human and material damages: the case of the lisbon metropolitan area,NATURAL HAZARDS,"In this study, both human and material damages caused by different types of flooding in the lisbon metropolitan area (lma) were determined for the first time. Human damages (fatalities, evacuated and displaced people) were obtained from the disaster database (1865-2010 period). Material damages' estimation was obtained from the portuguese association of insurers database for the period 2000-2010. A classification of types of flooding based on the hydrological/physical features of the territory separating fluvial floods (slow and flash floods) from urban flooding (related and unrelated to the ancient natural drainage network-fren and funn) was used. Topographic maps from the nineteenth and twentieth centuries (1:10,000 and 1:25,000 scales), information from newspapers and daily rainfall data were used to define this classification and to validate the flooding occurrences. It was concluded that: (1) during 146 years, 131 flooding events with human damages occurred in the lma, (2) 120 flooding events with material damages were registered in 1781 places for 11 years, (3) the spatial distribution of human and material damages was very different, (4) each type of flooding caused distinct human and material damages, (5) the importance of each type of flooding varied over time due to human interventions in the territory, (6) there is a clear decrease in the mortality associated with flooding even during the extreme flooding events. This study contributes for spatial planning and insurance companies, allowing to define the temporal evolution and spatial patterns of the types of flooding, as well as to understand their future damages.",TYPES OF FLOODING; HUMAN DAMAGES; MATERIAL DAMAGES; DISASTER DATABASE; INSURANCE DATABASE; LISBON METROPOLITAN AREA,HYDRO-GEOMORPHOLOGIC DISASTERS; CLIMATE-CHANGE IMPACTS; RISK-MANAGEMENT; INSURANCE DATA; FLASH FLOODS; URBAN AREAS; SURFACE; CATALONIA; PORTUGAL; SPAIN,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"AERTS JCJH, 2011, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V21, P1045, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2011.04.005.;ANDRE C, 2013, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V13, P2003, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-13-2003-2013.;ARCHETTI R, 2011, HYDROL EARTH SYST SC, V15, P3115, DOI 10.5194/HESS-15-3115-2011.;ARONICA GT, 2005, HYDROL PROCESS, V19, P1105, DOI 10.1002/HYP.5648.;AZEVEDO TM, 2004, NAT HAZARDS, V31, P587, DOI 10.1023/B:NHAZ.0000024892.61336.EC.;BARNOLAS M, 2007, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V7, P271, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-7-271-2007.;BARRERA A, 2006, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V6, P505, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-6-505-2006.;BARRIENDOS M, 2003, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V3, P583, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-3-583-2003.;BARRIENDOS M, 2006, HYDROLOG SCI J, V51, P765, DOI 10.1623/HYSJ.51.5.765.;BECKER JS, 2015, WEATHER CLIM SOC, V7, P321, DOI 10.1175/WCAS-D-14-00030.1.;BENITO G, 2003, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V58, P171, DOI 10.1023/A:1023417102053.;BRAZDIL R, 2006, HYDROLOG SCI J, V51, P739, DOI 10.1623/HYSJ.51.5.739.;BUTLER D., 2004, URBAN DRAINAGE.;CAMARASA-BELMONTE AM, 2012, LANDSCAPE URBAN PLAN, V104, P189, DOI 10.1016/J.LANDURBPLAN.2011.10.009.;CHANG TJ, 2015, J HYDROL, V524, P662, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2015.03.014.;CHEN WB, 2014, WATER-SUI, V6, P3182, DOI 10.3390/W6103182.;CNT, 2014, THE PREVALENCE AND C.;CROMPTON RP, 2008, ENVIRON SCI POLICY, V11, P371, DOI 10.1016/J.ENVSCI.2008.01.005.;DE MOEL H, 2011, NAT HAZARDS, V58, P407, DOI 10.1007/S11069-010-9675-6.;DIAKAKIS M, 2016, INT J DISAST RISK RE, V18, P171, DOI 10.1016/J.IJDRR.2016.06.010.;FALCONER RH, 2009, J FLOOD RISK MANAG, V2, P198, DOI 10.1111/J.1753-318X.2009.01034.X.;FRAGOSO M, 2004, RELATORIO 39.;FRAGOSO M., 2011, 244251FP7ENV2009215, P29.;FRAGOSO M, 2010, WEATHER, V65, P31, DOI 10.1002/WEA.513.;HAMMOND MJ, 2015, URBAN WATER J, V12, P14, DOI 10.1080/1573062X.2013.857421.;HOEPPE P, 2016, WEATHER CLIM EXTREME, V11, P70, DOI 10.1016/J.WACE.2015.10.002.;HUONG HTL, 2013, HYDROL EARTH SYST SC, V17, P379, DOI 10.5194/HESS-17-379-2013.;HURFORD AP, 2012, INT J CLIMATOL, V32, P1768, DOI 10.1002/JOC.2391.;JHA AK, 2012, CITIES AND FLOODING: A GUIDE TO INTEGRATED URBAN FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT FOR THE 21ST CENTURY, P1, DOI 10.1596/978-0-8213-8866-2.;JONGMAN B, 2014, NAT CLIM CHANGE, V4, P264, DOI [10.1038/NCLIMATE2124, 10.1038/NCLIMATE2124].;LEAL M, 2013, FINISTERRA, V95, P17, DOI DOI 10.18055/FINIS3129.;LIBERATO MLR, 2012, GEOPHYS MONOGR SER, V200, P111, DOI 10.1029/2012GM001244.;LLASAT MC, 2013, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V13, P1337, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-13-1337-2013.;LLASAT MC, 2009, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V9, P1201, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-9-1201-2009.;LLASAT M.

525,Zhou Q;Su J;Leng G;Peng J,The role of hazard and vulnerability in modulating economic damages of inland floods in the united states using a survey-based dataset,SUSTAINABILITY,"This study investigates the trends in economic damages caused by three types of inland floods (flash flood, flood, and heavy rain) in the united states and the variations in related hazard and vulnerability indicators between 1996 and 2016. We explore the underlying mechanisms based on a survey-based dataset maintained by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration (noaa) national weather service. An annual average of 6518 flood occurrences was reported, which caused economic damages of 3351 million usd per year. Flash flood and flood contributed to 53\% and 32\% of total occurrences and was associated with a larger share of damaging events (sde). Results show that the higher impacts by flood and flash flood on property and crop are partly attributed to the greater intensity of rainfall. In addition, flood has the highest unit cost of damages. Notably, despite an upward tendency in economic damages by flash floods, no evident change trend is observed for inland floods as a whole. Further analysis shows changes in economic damages by heavy rain and flash flood are mainly governed by the increased annual frequency and hazard intensity, but the change of trend in their vulnerability indicators (i.e., sde and damage per event (dpe)) is not obvious. Regarding floods, it was not possible to attribute the variations in economic losses to hazard and vulnerability, as no significant tendency is found except for an increasing sde. Despite limitations of length of records, data collection, and methodology, the difference in economic impacts and the related hazard and vulnerability revealed in this study can help better target future adaptation and mitigation measures.",ECONOMIC DAMAGES; HAZARD; VULNERABILITY; FLASH FLOOD; FLOOD; HEAVY RAIN,CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK-ASSESSMENT; LOSSES; TRENDS; WEATHER; RIVER; PRECIPITATION; IMPACTS; EUROPE; DISASTERS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"ZHOU, QQ (REPRINT AUTHOR), GUANGDONG UNIV TECHNOL, SCH CIVIL \& TRANSPORTAT ENGN, 100 WAIHUAN XI RD, GUANGZHOU 510006, GUANGDONG, PEOPLES R CHINA.;ZHOU, QIANQIAN, SU, JIONGHENG, GUANGDONG UNIV TECHNOL, SCH CIVIL \& TRANSPORTAT ENGN, 100 WAIHUAN XI RD, GUANGZHOU 510006, GUANGDONG, PEOPLES R CHINA.;LENG, GUOYONG, UNIV OXFORD, ENVIRONM CHANGE INST, OXFORD OX1 3QY, ENGLAND.;PENG, JIAN, UNIV OXFORD, SCH GEOG \& ENVIRONM, OXFORD OX1 3QY, ENGLAND.",10.3390/SU11133754,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,"NATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINANATIONAL NATURAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION OF CHINA [51809049]; SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY PROGRAM OF GUANGZHOU, CHINA [201804010406]; PUBLIC WELFARE RESEARCH AND ABILITY CONSTRUCTION PROJECT OF GUANGDONG PROVINCE, CHINA [2017A020219003]",,2071-1050,13,,MDPI,11,2019,ISI000477051900244,44,"SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY - OTHER TOPICS, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY",7,"GREEN \& SUSTAINABLE SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES",QIAZGDUT.EDU.CN,,IL1IB,,"ZHOU, QQ (REPRINT AUTHOR), GUANGDONG UNIV TECHNOL, SCH CIVIL \& TRANSPORTAT ENGN, 100 WAIHUAN XI RD, GUANGZHOU 510006, GUANGDONG, PEOPLES R CHINA",ISI,GUANGDONG UNIV TECHNOL;UNIV OXFORD;UNIV OXFORD,GUANGDONG UNIV TECHNOL,,"ZHOU Q, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY","ZHOU Q, 2019, SUSTAINABILITY",FALSE,1,0,2,0,0,2,8_13,0,1

Damage caused by flood events was discussed, together with rainfall regime and trend (for the period in which data are available) and with main modifications due to population variations. The aim was to assess if the frequency of damaging floods is changing, and if there is a role of rainfall and/or of anthropic modifications of land-use on these changes. Of 150 damaging floods analysed, 4\% of the total were floods which caused damage to people, and which mainly occurred in past centuries. Notwithstanding, the trend of damaging floods is increasing due to the effects of floods observed in the last decades. At the same time, the rainfall trend is generally decreasing, as observed at a regional scale, and is not significant enough to justify the flood recurrence increase. The population trend is characterised by a huge increase observed in recent decades. On this basis, the progressive urban enlargement, with no care for drainage network characteristics and extreme floods, can be considered as the main source of increasing risks due to damaging floods.",FLOODS; HISTORICAL RESEARCH; RAINFALL TREND; LAND USE; CALABRIA; ITALY,DOCUMENTARY SOURCES,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,3,"GLASER R, 2003, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V3, P1.;LASTORIA B., 2006, ADV GEOSCI, V7, P223, DOI DOI 10.5194/ADGE0-7-223-2006.;LLASAT MC, 2005, J HYDROL, V313, P32, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2005.02.004.;NAULET R, 2005, J HYDROL, V313, P58, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2005.02.011.;PETRUCCI O, 2007, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V7, P361, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-7-361-2007.;PETRUCCI O, 2003, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V3, P17, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-3-17-2003.;PETRUCCI O., 2005, FRANE ALLUVIONI PROV.;PETRUCCI O., 2009, FRANE ALLUVIONI PROV.;PETRUCCI O., 2007, FRANE ALLUVIONI PROV.;POLEMIO M, 2008, GEOL SOC SPEC PUBL, V288, P39, DOI 10.1144/SP288.4.;POLEMIO M, 2010, Z GEOMORPHOL, V54, P195, DOI 10.1127/0372-8854/2010/0054S2-0011.;TRAVAGLINI G., 1985, STORIA ITALIA REGION.","PETRUCCI, O (REPRINT AUTHOR), CNR, IRPI, VIA CAVOUR 4-6, I-87030 ARCAVACATA DI RENDE, ITALY.;PETRUCCI, OLGA, PASQUA, ANGELA AURORA, CNR, IRPI, VIA CAVOUR 4-6, I-87030 ARCAVACATA DI RENDE, ITALY.;POLEMIO, MAURIZIO, CNR, IRPI, I-70126 BARI, ITALY.",,"INST OF HYDROLOGY, WALLINGFORD OX10 8BB, ENGLAND","SERVAT, E AND DEMUTH, S AND DEZETTER, A AND DANIELL, T",,978-1-907161-13-1,0144-7815,,103+,INT ASSOC HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES,340,2010,ISI000298021900013,12,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, WATER RESOURCES",4,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",OLGA.PETRUCCIIRPI.CNR.IT,IAHS PUBLICATION,BYC84,GLOBAL CHANGE: FACING RISKS AND THREATS TO WATER RESOURCES,"PETRUCCI, O (REPRINT AUTHOR), CNR, IRPI, VIA CAVOUR 4-6, I-87030 ARCAVACATA DI RENDE, ITALY",ISI,CNR;CNR,CNR,,"PETRUCCI O, 2010, GLOBAL CHANGE: FACING RISKS AND THREATS TO WATER RESOURCES","PETRUCCI O, 2010, GLOBAL CHANGE: FACING RISKS AND THREATS TO WATER RESOURCES",FALSE,0,3,0,0,0,6,8_13,0,2

Mountainous cities like fuzhou, china, usually experience both types of hazard concurrently and are susceptible to these hazards. Therefore, it is necessary to take comprehensive defense measures to prevent and/or mitigate the impacts of these hazards. In this study, the authors first reviewed the progress of prevention measures of these two types of hazards in china through the nationwide construction of sponge cities and national flash flood prevention projects. The authors then analyzed the characteristics of waterlogging and flash flood hazards in china using 25years of records from the chinese government and elaborated the causes and existing issues. Results show that flash floods and urban waterlogging in mountainous cities have exacerbated the severity of flood hazards. Based on the typical effective measures of such flood hazard prevention systems, the authors also discussed the possible comprehensive preventive measures to be implemented in fuzhou via the spongy city construction, which can provide a reference for future flood management.",SPONGE CITY; MOUNTAINOUS URBAN WATERLOGGING; FLASH FLOOD HAZARDS; FUZHOU CITY; SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT,MANAGEMENT; RISK,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,2,"BLAKE E.

317,Dolak L;Brazdil R;Valasek H,"Hydrological and meteorological extremes derived from taxation records: the estates of brtnice, trebic and velke mezirici, 1706-1849",HYDROLOGICAL SCIENCES JOURNAL-JOURNAL DES SCIENCES HYDROLOGIQUES,"This paper addresses the hydrological and meteorological extremes that may be deduced from the taxation records of the estates of brtnice, trebic and velke mezirici, all in the moravian-bohemian highlands of the czech republic, for the years 1706-1849. At that time, damage to agricultural crops constituted grounds for tax remission for individual farmers and landowners. Where it survives, the relevant administrative documentation generally includes a statement from the applicant, a report by the official commission tasked with checking the contents of it, and any decisions made by taxation authorities at regional and ``land level (the jihlava regional office and the moravian land administration (gubernium) respectively). Data extracted may include the type of event, dating, places of occurrence and damage done. The chronology of hydrological and meteorological extremes (torrential rain, flash flood, flood, hailstorm, lightning, frost) covers the period 1706-1849, but only four events are evident before 1748 and there is a gap in records between 1757 and 1789. Extremes are analysed from a spatio-temporal point of view. A total of 97 extreme events (171 extremes of particular type) were identified for the region studied. Torrential rain, hailstorm and flash flood were the major devastating phenomena, and occurred mainly from may to august. Torrential rain and hailstorm are clearly attributable to thunderstorms with very intense convection. Five outstanding events and their impacts upon individual farmers are described in detail. The results are discussed with respect to uncertainties in the basic data and in the context of the czech lands, because only some of the extremes disclosed are known and confirmed by other documentary data.",TAXATION SYSTEM; TAX REMISSION; HYDROLOGICAL EXTREME; METEOROLOGICAL EXTREME; FLUCTUATION; HAILSTORM; TORRENTIAL RAIN; FLASH FLOOD; HUMAN IMPACT,CLIMATE-CHANGE; ICE-AGE; EUROPE; PRECIPITATION; PROJECTIONS; EVENTS; FLOODS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,7,"[ANONYMOUS], 1846, MARKGRAFSCHAFT MAHRE.;BARRIENDOS M., 2004, SYSTEMATIC PALAEOFLO, P29.;BARTOS J., 1988, HISTORICKY MISTOPIS, VXI.;BECKOVA J., 2008, VALDSTEJNOVE TREBIC.;BENISTON M, 2007, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V81, P71, DOI 10.1007/S10584-006-9226-Z.;BRAZDIL R, 2005, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V70, P363, DOI 10.1007/S10584-005-5924-1.;BRAZDIL R, 2006, GEOGR ANN A, V88A, P79, DOI 10.1111/J.0435-3676.2006.00285.X.;BRAZDIL R, 2012, CLIM PAST, V8, P467, DOI 10.5194/CP-8-467-2012.;BRAZDIL R, 2003, GEOGRAFICKY CASOPIS, V55, P325.;BRAZDIL R, 2012, TEMPERATURE PRECIPIT.;BRAZDIL R., 2008, HIST KONTEXTU OSTATN, P263.;BRAZDIL R., 2011, POVODNE BRNE HIST PO.;BRAZDIL R., 2012, IAHS SPECIAL PUBLICA, P121, DOI [10.1201/B12348-9, DOI 10.1201/B12348-9].;BRAZDIL R., 2003, METEOROLOGICKY CASOP, V6, P3.;BRAZDIL R, 2006, HYDROLOG SCI J, V51, P739, DOI 10.1623/HYSJ.51.5.739.;BRAZDIL R, 2010, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V101, P7, DOI 10.1007/S10584-009-9783-Z.;BULLON T, 2011, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V11, P2215, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-11-2215-2011.;BUZEK, 2010, SPOLECNOST CESKYCH Z.;CHANGNON D, 1997, WORKSH IND IND CLIM.;CHROMA K., 2011, METEOROLOGICKE ZPRAV, V64, P23.;CZDB, HIST CLIM DAT CZECH.;DEMEK JAROMIR, 2006, ZEMEPISNY LEXIKON CR.;DOLAK L., 2010, THESIS MASARYK U BRN.;DVORSKY F., 1906, TREBICSKY OKRES, P66.;FUSSEL HM, 2009, CLIMATIC CHANGE, V97, P469, DOI 10.1007/S10584-009-9648-5.;GARCIA R, 2003, B AM METEOROL SOC, V84, P1037, DOI 10.1175/BAMS-84-8-1037.;GROVE J.

Historical information can help us to place recent events in context and to understand the effect of low frequency climate variability on changing flash flood frequencies. Previous studies have focussed on fluvial flooding to reconstruct the temporal and spatial patterns of past events. Here, we provide an online flood chronology for the north and south-west of england for flash floods, including both surface water and fluvial flooding, with coverage from similar to 1700 to similar to 2013 (). The primary source of documentary material is local newspaper reports, which often give detailed descriptions of impacts. This provides a new resource to inform communities and first responders of flood risks, especially those from rapid rise in water level whose severity may be greater than those of accompanying peak flow. Examples are provided of historical flash floods that exemplify how the chronologies can help to place recent floods in the context of the preinstrumental record for: (a) more robust estimates of event return period, (b) identification of catchment or settlement susceptibility to flash flood events, and (c) characterisation of events in ungauged catchments.",EXTREME EVENTS; FLASH FLOOD; FLOOD CHRONOLOGIES; HISTORICAL HYDROLOGY,FREQUENCY-ANALYSIS; CLIMATE-CHANGE; RISK; RAINFALL; STATIONARITY; PALEOFLOOD; BRITAIN; EVENTS; EUROPE; NORTH,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,3,none,"O'DONNELL, G (REPRINT AUTHOR), NEWCASTLE UNIV, DEPT ENGN, NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE NE1 7RU, TYNE \& WEAR, ENGLAND.;ARCHER, DAVID, O'DONNELL, GREG, FOWLER, HAYLEY J., NEWCASTLE UNIV, SCH ENGN, WATER RESOURCE SYST RES LAB, NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, TYNE \& WEAR, ENGLAND.;ARCHER, DAVID, LAMB, ROB, WARREN, SARAH, JBA TRUST, BROUGHTON HALL, SKIPTON, NORTH YORKS, ENGLAND.;LAMB, ROB, UNIV LANCASTER, LANCASTER ENVIRONM CTR, BAILRIGG, ENGLAND.",10.1111/JFR3.12526,"111 RIVER ST, HOBOKEN 07030-5774, NJ USA",,ROYAL SOCIETYROYAL SOCIETY OF LONDON; WOLFSON FOUNDATION; NERCNERC NATURAL ENVIRONMENT RESEARCH COUNCIL [NE/K00896X/1],,1753-318X,1,,WILEY,12,2019,ISI000485980500019,61,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, WATER RESOURCES",7,"ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, WATER RESOURCES",G.M.ODONNELLNCL.AC.UK,,IX9AX,,"O'DONNELL, G (REPRINT AUTHOR), NEWCASTLE UNIV, DEPT ENGN, NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE NE1 7RU, TYNE \& WEAR, ENGLAND",ISI,NEWCASTLE UNIV;ARCHER;UNIV LANCASTER,NEWCASTLE UNIV,,"ARCHER D, 2019, J FLOOD RISK MANAG","ARCHER D, 2019, J FLOOD RISK MANAG",FALSE,0,0,0,0,0,7,8_13_14,0,4

In the near future, climate and societal changes as both urbanization of flood prone areas and individual dangerous behaviors could increase flood fatalities. This paper analyzes flood mortality in eight countries using a 39-year database (1980-2018) named euff (european flood fatalities), which was built using documentary sources. The narratives of fatalities were investigated and standardized in the database reporting the details of the events. The entire dataset shows a stable trend on flood fatalities, despite the existence of individual increasing (greece, italy, and south france) and decreasing (turkey and catalonia) trends. The 2466 fatalities were mainly males, aged between 30-49 years and the majority of them happened outdoor. Most often people were dragged by water/mud when travelling by motor vehicles. Some cases of hazardous behaviors, such as fording rivers, were also detected. The primary cause of death was drowning, followed by heart attack. This work contributes to understand the human-flood interaction that caused fatalities. The changes in society's vulnerability highlighted throughout this study contribute to manage future risks, to improve people protection actions, and to reduce risk behaviors.",FLOOD; FATALITY; SPATIOTEMPORAL VARIABILITY; RISK; VULNERABILITY; EUROPE,FLASH-FLOOD; MEDITERRANEAN REGION; CIRCUMSTANCES; MORTALITY; DISASTER; VULNERABILITY; AUSTRALIA; PATTERNS; DATABASE; BELIEFS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,4,none,"PETRUCCI, O (REPRINT AUTHOR), CNR IRPI NATL RES COUNCIL RES INST GEOHYDROL PROT, I-87036 COSENZA, ITALY.;PETRUCCI, OLGA, ACETO, LUIGI, PASQUA, ANGELA AURORA, CNR IRPI NATL RES COUNCIL RES INST GEOHYDROL PROT, I-87036 COSENZA, ITALY.;BIANCHI, CINZIA, SALVATI, PAOLA, CNR IRPI NATL RES COUNCIL RES INST GEOHYDROL PROT, I-06128 PERUGIA, ITALY.;BIGOT, VICTORIA, VINET, FREDDY, UNIV PAUL VALERY MONTPELLIER 3, F-34090 MONTPELLIER, FRANCE.;BRAZDIL, RUDOLF, REHOR, JAN, MASARYK UNIV, FAC SCI, DEPT GEOG, CS-61137 BRNO, CZECH REPUBLIC.;BRAZDIL, RUDOLF, ZEZERE, JOSE LUIS, CZECH ACAD SCI, GLOBAL CHANGE RES INST, BRNO 60300, CZECH REPUBLIC.;PEREIRA, SUSANA, UNIV LISBON, CTR ESTUDOS GEOG, INST GEOG \& ORDENAMENTO TERR, P-1600276 LISBON, PORTUGAL.;KAHRAMAN, ABDULLAH, KILIC, OZGENUR, SAMSUN UNIV, DEPT METEOROL ENGN, FAC AERONAUT \& ASTRONAUT, TR-55420 SAMSUN, TURKEY.;KOTRONI, VASSILIKI, PAPAGIANNAKI, KATERINA, NATL OBSERV ATHENS, INST ENVIRONM RES \& SUSTAINABLE DEV, ATHENS 15236, GREECE.;CARMEN LLASAT, MARIA, LLASAT-BOTIJA, MONTSERRAT, UNIV BARCELONA, DEPT APPL PHYS, E-08028 BARCELONA, SPAIN.;ROSSELLO GELI, JOAN, UNIV ILLES BALEARS, GRP CLIMATOL HIDROL RISCS \& PAISATGE, PALMA DE MALLORCA 07122, SPAIN.",10.3390/W11081682,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,"MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, YOUTH AND SPORTS OF THE CZECH REPUBLICMINISTRY OF EDUCATION, YOUTH \& SPORTS - CZECH REPUBLIC [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16\_019/0000797]; MASARYK UNIVERSITY [MUNI/A/1576/2018]; FCT-PORTUGUESE FOUNDATION FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY, I.P.

101,Zhong S;Clark M;Hou Xy;Zang Yl;Fitzgerald G,2010-2011 queensland floods: using haddon's matrix to define and categorise public safety strategies,EMERGENCY MEDICINE AUSTRALASIA,"Objective: the 2010-2011 queensland floods resulted in the most deaths from a single flood event in australia since 1916. This article analyses the information on these deaths for comparison with those from previous floods in modern australia in an attempt to identify factors that have contributed to those deaths. Haddon's matrix, originally designed for prevention of road trauma, offers a framework for understanding the interplay between contributing factors and helps facilitate a clearer understanding of the varied strategies required to ensure people's safety for particular flood types. Methods: public reports and flood relevant literature were searched using key words `flood', `fatality', `mortality', `death', `injury' and `victim' through google scholar, pubmed, proquest and ebsco. Data relating to reported deaths during the 2010-2011 queensland floods, and relevant data of previous australian flood fatality (1997-2009) were collected from these available sources. These sources were also used to identify contributing factors. Results: there were 33 deaths directly attributed to the event, of which 54.5\% were swept away in a flash flood on 10 january 2011. A further 15.1\% of fatalities were caused by inappropriate behaviours. This is different to floods in modern australia where over 90\% of deaths are related to the choices made by individuals. There is no single reason why people drown in floods, but rather a complex interplay of factors. Conclusions: the present study and its integration of research findings and conceptual frameworks might assist governments and communities to develop policies and strategies to prevent flood injury and fatalities.",FLASH FLOOD; FLOOD FATALITY; HADDON'S COUNTERMEASURE; HADDON'S MATRIX; QUEENSLAND FLOOD,FLASH FLOODS; HEALTH-CARE; DISASTER; IMPACTS; PEOPLE; RISK,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,10,"AHEM M, 2005, FLOODS HAZARDS HLTH, P28.;APAN A., 2010, 2008 FLOODS QUEENSL.;AXELROD C, 1994, PUBLIC HEALTH REP, V109, P601.;BARNETT DJ, 2005, ENVIRON HEALTH PERSP, V113, P561, DOI 10.1289/EHP.7491.;BELL H.

Chronicles, ``books of memory, weather diaries, newspapers (media), parliamentary proposals, epigraphic evidence, systematic meteorological/hydrological observations, and professional papers provide a broad base for gathering such information in the czech republic, especially since 1901. The spatiotemporal variability of 269 fatalities in the czech republic arising out of 103 hmes (flood, flash flood, windstorm, convective storm, lightning, frost, snow/glaze-ice calamity, heat, and other events) in the 1981-2018 period is presented, with particular attention to closer characterisation of fatalities (gender, age, cause of death, place, type of death, and behaviour). Examples of three outstanding events with the highest numbers of fatalities (severe frosts in the extremely cold winter of 1928/1929, a flash flood on 9 june 1970, and a rain flood in july 1997) are described in detail. Discussion of results includes the problem of data uncertainty, factors influencing the numbers of fatalities, and the broader context. Since floods are responsible for the highest proportion of hme-related deaths, places with fatalities are located mainly around rivers and drowning appears as the main cause of death. In the further classification of fatalities, males and adults clearly prevail, while indirect victims and hazardous behaviour are strongly represented.",FATALITY; FATALITY FEATURES; DOCUMENTARY DATA; HYDROLOGICAL AND METEOROLOGICAL EVENT; CZECH REPUBLIC,FLOOD FATALITIES; EUROPEAN CLIMATE; MORTALITY; PRECIPITATION; TEMPERATURE; AUSTRALIA; INJURIES; PATTERNS; IMPACTS; DEATHS,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,0,none,"BRAZDIL, R (REPRINT AUTHOR), MASARYK UNIV, INST GEOG, CS-61137 BRNO, CZECH REPUBLIC.;BRAZDIL, R (REPRINT AUTHOR), CZECH ACAD SCI, GLOBAL CHANGE RES INST, BRNO 60300, CZECH REPUBLIC.;BRAZDIL, RUDOLF, REHOR, JAN, DOLAK, LUKAS, REZNICKOVA, LADISLAVA, DOBROVOLNY, PETR, MASARYK UNIV, INST GEOG, CS-61137 BRNO, CZECH REPUBLIC.;BRAZDIL, RUDOLF, CHROMA, KATERINA, ZAHRADNICEK, PAVEL, DOLAK, LUKAS, REZNICKOVA, LADISLAVA, DOBROVOLNY, PETR, CZECH ACAD SCI, GLOBAL CHANGE RES INST, BRNO 60300, CZECH REPUBLIC.;ZAHRADNICEK, PAVEL, CZECH HYDROMETEOROL INST, BRNO 61667, CZECH REPUBLIC.",10.3390/W11102014,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",,"MINISTRY OF EDUCATION, YOUTH, AND SPORTS OF THE CZECH REPUBLICMINISTRY OF EDUCATION, YOUTH \& SPORTS - CZECH REPUBLIC [CZ.02.1.01/0.0/0.0/16\_019/0000797]",,,10,,MDPI,11,2019,ISI000495598400058,84,WATER RESOURCES,0,WATER RESOURCES,BRAZDILSCI.MUNI.CZ KCHROMAEMAIL.CZ 433735MAIL.MUNI.CZ ZAHRADNICEK.PCZECHGLOBE.CZ DOLAKSCI.MUNI.CZ LADKARSCI.MUNI.CZ DOBROSCI.MUNI.CZ,,JL5VD,,"BRAZDIL, R (REPRINT AUTHOR), MASARYK UNIV, INST GEOG, CS-61137 BRNO, CZECH REPUBLIC",ISI,MASARYK UNIV;GLOBAL CHANGE RES INST;CZECH HYDROMETEOROL INST,MASARYK UNIV,,"BRAZDIL R, 2019, WATER","BRAZDIL R, 2019, WATER",TRUE,0,5,3,0,0,1,8_13_16,0,1

However, the implementation of this tool in post-communist central european countries is constrained by the strong position of the central government and a weakened civil society as a heritage of the former communist governments. This study analyses documentary sources to reconstruct social responses to five disastrous flash flood events (1897, 1907, 1925, 1926 and 1927) in northern bohemia, czech republic. The reconstruction of social responses has revealed their complexity and strong component of a participatory approach. The analysis shows that certain historical measures and approaches to recovery from flash floods can be useful for re-establishing and reinforcing former social patterns in post-communist transition countries in terms of strategies for disaster risk reduction.",FLASH FLOOD; SOCIAL RESPONSE; PARTICIPATORY APPROACH; COMMUNITY-BASED EXPERIENCE; DOCUMENTARY DATA,RESILIENCE; VULNERABILITY; DISASTERS; HAZARDS; STATE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,9,"AMROVA L, 2006, FLOOD IMPACTS THEIR.;BATESON G., 1972, STEPS ECOLOGY MIND C.;BEZKOVA L, 2011, ENV SOFTWARE SYSTEMS, P550.;BOTZEN WJW, 2009, ECOL ECON, V68, P2265, DOI 10.1016/J.ECOLECON.2009.02.019.;BRAZDIL R, 2002, GEOGRAFIE, V107, P349.;BUBECK P, 2012, RISK ANAL, V32, P1481, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.2011.01783.X.;BURKE PETER, 2001, EYEWITNESSING USES I.;CHOULARTON R, 2001, SAFETY SCI, V39, P61, DOI 10.1016/S0925-7535(01)00026-1.;CORBACIOGLU S, 2006, DISASTERS, V30, P212, DOI 10.1111/J.0361-3666.2006.00316.X.;CREUTIN JD, 2013, J HYDROL, V482, P14, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2012.11.009.;CUTTER SL, 1996, PROG HUM GEOG, V20, P529, DOI 10.1177/030913259602000407.;DAHELKA J, 2011, METEOROLOGICKE ZPRAV, V64, P4.;DELICA-WILLISON ZENAIDA, 2004, MAPPING VULNERABILIT, P145.;DIETZSCHOLD G, 1928, METEOROLOGIE, V45, P135.;DOSTAL P, 2005, AUC GEOGRAPHICA, V41, P1.;ELANDER I, 2006, EUROPEAN J POLITICAL, P295.;ELSTER J., 1998, I DESIGN POSTCOMMUNI.;FOLKE C, 2006, GLOBAL ENVIRON CHANG, V16, P253, DOI 10.1016/J.GLOENVCHA.2006.04.002.;GAUME E, 2009, J HYDROL, V367, P70, DOI 10.1016/J.JHYDROL.2008.12.028.;GERRARD CM, 2013, NAT HAZARDS, V69, P1051, DOI 10.1007/S11069-013-0750-7.;GLADE T, 2001, USE HIST DATA NATURA.;HOWARD M.

This study is the first of its kind to assemble, reprocess, describe, and disseminate a georeferenced u.s. Database providing a long-term, detailed characterization of flash flooding in terms of spatiotemporal behavior and specificity of impacts. The database is composed of three primary sources: 1) the entire archive of automated discharge observations from the u.s. Geological survey that has been reprocessed to describe individual flooding events, 2) flash-flooding reports collected by the national weather service from 2006 to the present, and 3) witness reports obtained directly from the public in the severe hazards analysis and verification experiment during the summers 2008-10. Each observational data source has limitations, a major asset of the unified flash flood database is its collation of relevant information from a variety of sources that is now readily available to the community in common formats. It is anticipated that this database will be used for many diverse purposes, such as evaluating tools to predict flash flooding, characterizing seasonal and regional trends, and improving understanding of dominant flood-producing processes.

52,Jacobs L;Dewitte O;Poesen J;Delvaux D;Thiery W;Kervyn M,"The rwenzori mountains, a landslide-prone region?",LANDSLIDES,"With its exceptionally steep topography, wet climate, and active faulting, landslides can be expected to occur in the rwenzori mountains. Whether or not this region is prone to landsliding and more generally whether global landslide inventories and hazard assessments are accurate in data-poor regions such as the east african highlands are thus far unclear. In order to address these questions, a first landslide inventory based on archive information is built for the rwenzori mountains. In total, 48 landslide and flash flood events, or combinations of these, are found. They caused 56 fatalities and considerable damage to road infrastructure, buildings, and cropland, and rendered over 14,000 persons homeless. These numbers indicate that the rwenzori mountains are landslide-prone and that the impact of these events is significant. Although not based on field investigations but on archive data from media reports and laymen accounts, our approach provides a useful complement to global inventories overlooking this region and increases our understanding of the phenomenon in the rwenzori mountains. Considering the severe impacts of landslides, the population growth and related anthropogenic interventions, and the likelihood of more intense rainfall conditions, there is an urgent need to invest in research on disaster risk reduction strategies in this region and other similar highland areas of africa.",MASS MOVEMENT; INVENTORY; EQUATORIAL MOUNTAINS; ARCHIVE ANALYSIS; TRIGGERING FACTORS,GLOBAL LANDSLIDE; WESTERN RIFT; DEBRIS FLOWS; UGANDA; EARTHQUAKES; CLIMATE; AFRICA; ELGON; SUSCEPTIBILITY; FOOTSLOPES,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,26,"AKKERMANS T, 2014, J CLIMATE, V27, P2714, DOI 10.1175/JCLI-D-13-00361.1.;BAGOORA FDK, 1988, MT RES DEV, V8, P173, DOI 10.2307/3673445.;BAUER FU, 2012, J AFR EARTH SCI, V73-74, P44, DOI 10.1016/J.JAFREARSCI.2012.07.001.;BAUER FU, 2010, INT J EARTH SCI, V99, P1575, DOI 10.1007/S00531-010-0549-7.;BRADY NC, 2008, NATURE PROPERTIES SO.;BRINK AB, 2014, INT J APPL EARTH OBS, V28, P60, DOI 10.1016/J.JAG.2013.11.006.;BUGOYE SUB-COUNTY LOCAL GOVERNMENT, 2014, INTERNAL REPORT.;CHANG KT, 2007, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V89, P335, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2006.12.011.;CHE VB, 2011, NAT HAZARDS, V59, P47, DOI 10.1007/S11069-011-9738-3.;CIESIN FAO CIAT (CENTER FOR INTERNATIONAL EARTH SCIENCE INFORMATION NETWORK-CIESIN-COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY UNITED NATIONS FOOD AND AGRICULTURE PROGRAMME-FAO AND CENTRO INTERNACIONAL DE AGRICULTURA TROPICAL-CIAT), 2005, GRIDD POP WORLD VERS.;CLAESSENS L, 2007, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V90, P23, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2007.01.007.;COROMINAS J, 2014, B ENG GEOL ENVIRON, V73, P209, DOI 10.1007/S10064-013-0538-8.;CROZIER MJ, 2010, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V124, P260, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2010.04.009.;CUI P, 2013, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V182, P173, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2012.11.009.;DAVIES TC, 1996, J AFR EARTH SCI, V23, P541, DOI 10.1016/S0899-5362(97)00017-1.;DAVIES TRH, 2013, EARTH SURF PROC LAND, V38, P1261, DOI 10.1002/ESP.3377.;DAVIN EL, 2012, BIOGEOSCIENCES, V9, P1695, DOI 10.5194/BG-9-1695-2012.;DELVAUX D, 2015, NEOTECTONIC FAULTS S.;DELVAUX D, 2010, TECTONOPHYSICS, V482, P105, DOI 10.1016/J.TECTO.2009.05.009.;DEPARTMENT OF LANDS AND SURVEYS UGANDA, 1972, TOP MAPS UG SER Y, VY732.;DEWITTE O, 2013, GEODERMA, V211, P138, DOI 10.1016/J.GEODERMA.2013.07.007.;EGGERMONT H, 2007, HYDROBIOLOGIA, V592, P151, DOI 10.1007/S10750-007-0741-3.;EGGERMONT H, 2009, MONOGR BIOL, V89, P243.;EL MORJANI Z.E.A., 2011, METHODOLOGY DOCUMENT, V1.;EM-DAT, 2009, OFDA CRED INT DIS DA.;EVANS SG, 1994, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V10, P107, DOI 10.1016/0169-555X(94)90011-6.;FAO, 2001, FAO WORLD SOIL RES R, V94.;FAO/ IIASA/ ISRIC/ ISS- CAS/ JRC, 2012, HARM WORLD SOIL DAT.;FIELD CB, 2012, SPECIAL REPORT WORKI.;GARZANTI E, 2013, GEOCHEM GEOPHY GEOSY, V14, P292, DOI 10.1002/GGGE.20060.;GEONAMES, 2014, GEONAMES GEOGR DAT.;GILL JC, 2014, REV GEOPHYS, V52, P680, DOI 10.1002/2013RG000445.;GLOBAL ADMINISTRATIVE AREAS, 2012, GADM DAT GLOB ADM AR.;GROSSE P, 2012, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V136, P114, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2011.06.001.;GTK CONSORTIUM, 2012, MIN WEALTH C 2012 KA.;GUZZETTI F, 2008, LANDSLIDES, V5, P3, DOI 10.1007/S10346-007-0112-1.;HONG Y, 2008, INT J SEDIMENT RES, V23, P249, DOI 10.1016/S1001-6279(08)60022-0.;HONG Y, 2007, NAT HAZARDS, V43, P245, DOI 10.1007/S11069-006-9104-Z.;JAGGER P, 2014, ENERG POLICY, V67, P713, DOI 10.1016/J.ENPOL.2013.11.068.;JARVIS A., 2008, HOLE FILLED SRTM GLO.;KASER G., 2002, TROPICAL GLACIERS.;KAUFMANN G, 2012, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V138, P263, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2011.09.011.;KEEFER DK, 1984, GEOL SOC AM BULL, V95, P406, DOI 10.1130/0016-7606(1984)95<406:LCBE>2.0.CO,2.;KEEFER DK, 2002, SURV GEOPHYS, V23, P473, DOI 10.1023/A:1021274710840.;KERVYN F, 2013, GEORISK CENTRAL AFRI.;KIRSCHBAUM DB, 2010, NAT HAZARDS, V52, P561, DOI 10.1007/S11069-009-9401-4.;KITUTU MG, 2009, AFR J AGR RES, V4, P611.;KNAPEN A, 2006, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V73, P149, DOI 10.1016/J.GEOMORPH.2005.07.004.;KOEHN D, 2010, INT J EARTH SCI, V99, P1633, DOI 10.1007/S00531-010-0525-2.;LINDENFELD M, 2012, SOLID EARTH, V3, P251, DOI 10.5194/SE-3-251-2012.;LINDENFELD M, 2012, TECTONOPHYSICS, V566, P95, DOI 10.1016/J.TECTO.2012.07.010.;MAASHA N, 1975, TECTONOPHYSICS, V27, P381, DOI 10.1016/0040-1951(75)90005-0.;MAHANGO SUB-COUNTY LOCAL GOVERNMENT, 2013, DIS REP WHICH OCC 25.;MAHANGO SUB-COUNTY LOCAL GOVERNMENT, 2013, INTERNAL REPORT.;MAVONGA T, 2007, TECTONOPHYSICS, V439, P1, DOI 10.1016/J.TECTO.2007.01.006.;MUGAGGA F, 2012, CATENA, V90, P39, DOI 10.1016/J.CATENA.2011.11.004.;NADIM F, 2006, LANDSLIDES, V3, P159, DOI 10.1007/S10346-006-0036-1.;PARLIAMENT OF UGANDA, 2010, REP PARL M WEDN 10 M.;PETLEY D, 2012, GEOLOGY, V40, P927, DOI 10.1130/G33217.1.;RING U, 2008, TECTONICS, V27, DOI 10.1029/2007TC002176.;ROLLER S, 2012, J GEOPHYS RES-EARTH, V117, DOI 10.1029/2011JF002117.;RONAN KR, 2005, PROMOTING COMMUNITY, P105.;SANSA JO, 2012, P 5 UB ALL ANN C.;SIDLE R.

Work has initiated the building of a database gathering a detailed analysis of the circumstances of death and the profiles of the deceased (age, gender...). The study area covers the french mediterranean departments prone to flash floods over the period 1988-2015. This presentation details the main features of the sample, 244 fatalities collected through newspapers completed with field surveys near police services and municipalities. The sample is broken down between huge events that account for two thirds of the fatalities and ``small events (34 \% of the fatalities). Deaths at home account for 35 \% of the total number of fatalities, mainly during huge events. 30 \% of fatalities are related to vehicles. The last part of the work explains the relations between fatalities and prevention and how better knowledge of flood-related deaths can help to improve flood prevention. The given example shows the relationship between flood forecasting and fatalities. Half of the deaths took place in a small watershed (< 150 km(2)). It emphasizes the need for the dissemination of a complementary system of flash flood forecast based on forecasted rainfall depth and adapted to small watersheds.",,FLOOD FATALITIES; CHANGING CLIMATE; PARAMETERS; AUSTRALIA; RAINFALL; ENGLAND; STORM; US,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,3,"ANTOINE J.-M., 2001, ANN GEOGR, V110, P597.;ARNAUD P, 2014, HOUILLE BLANCHE, P20, DOI 10.1051/LHB/2014012.;ASHLEY ST, 2008, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V47, P805, DOI 10.1175/2007JAMC1611.1.;BECKER J.

Context: in april 2014, solomon islands experienced a flash flooding event that affected many areas and displaced a large number of people. In the capital, honiara, nearly 10 000 people were housed in emergency evacuation centres at the peak of the post-flood emergency. At the time of the floods, the number of dengue cases was increasing, following a record outbreak in 2013. Action: the national vector borne disease control programme with the assistance of the world health organization implemented an emergency vector-control response plan to provide protection to the at-risk populations in the evacuation centres. The national surveillance unit also activated an early warning disease surveillance system to monitor communicable diseases, including dengue and malaria. Outcome: timely and strategic application of the emergency interventions probably prevented an increase in dengue and malaria cases in the affected areas. Discussion: rapid and appropriate precautionary vector-control measures applied in a post-natural disaster setting can prevent and mitigate vectorborne disease incidences. Collecting vector surveillance data allows better analysis of vector-control operations' effectiveness.",,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,4,"[ANONYMOUS], 2009, DENG GUID DIAGN TREA.;BUGORO H, 2011, MALARIA J, V10, DOI 10.1186/1475-2875-10-262.;CHARLWOOD JD, 1986, PAPUA NEW GUINEA MED, V29, P19.;DARCY ANDREW, 2001, PAPUA NEW GUINEA MEDICAL JOURNAL, V44, P43.;DIBO MR, 2008, MEM I OSWALDO CRUZ, V103, P554, DOI 10.1590/S0074-02762008000600008.;DIENG H, 2012, INT J BIOMETEOROL, V56, P113, DOI 10.1007/S00484-011-0402-0.;GAGNON AS, 2002, INT J BIOMETEOROL, V46, P81, DOI 10.1007/S00484-001-0119-6.;HII YL, 2012, PLOS NEGLECT TROP D, V6, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PNTD.0001908.;MASUH H, 2008, PARASITOL RES, V103, P167, DOI 10.1007/S00436-008-0945-0.;NOGAREDA F, 2013, WEST PAC SURVEILL RE, V4, DOI [10.5365/WPSAR.2013.4.2.013, 10.5365/WPSAR.2013.4.2.013].;PAIK YH, 1987, JPN J EXP MED, V57, P47.;[WHO] WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, 2012, RAP RISK ASS AC PUBL.;YANG GJ, 2009, PLOS NEGLECT TROP D, V3, DOI 10.1371/JOURNAL.PNTD.0000385.","SHORTUS, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), WHO OFF REPRESENTAT SOLOMON ISL, HONIARA, SOLOMON ISLANDS.;SHORTUS, MATTHEW, MUSTO, JENNIE, WHO OFF REPRESENTAT SOLOMON ISL, HONIARA, SOLOMON ISLANDS.;BUGORO, HUGO, BUTAFA, CHARLES, MINIST HLTH \& MED SERV, NATL VECTOR BORNE DIS CONTROL PROGRAM, POINT CRUZ, HONIARA, SOLOMON ISLANDS.;SIO, ALISON, JOSHUA, CYNTHIA, MINIST HLTH \& MED SERV, NATL SURVEILLANCE UNIT, CHINATOWN, HONIARA, SOLOMON ISLANDS.",10.5365/WPSAR.2015.6.3.004,"PO BOX 2932, MANILA, 1000, PHILIPPINES",,WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATIONWORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION [001],,2094-7321,1,38-43,"WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION, REGIONAL OFFICE WESTERN PACIFIC",7,2016,ISI000383259400010,13,"PUBLIC, ENVIRONMENTAL \& OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH",3,"PUBLIC, ENVIRONMENTAL \& OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH",SHORTUSMWPRO.WHO.INT,,DV9KN,,"SHORTUS, M (REPRINT AUTHOR), WHO OFF REPRESENTAT SOLOMON ISL, HONIARA, SOLOMON ISLANDS",ISI,WHO OFF REPRESENTAT SOLOMON ISL;NATL VECTOR BORNE DIS CONTROL PROGRAM;NATL SURVEILLANCE UNIT,WHO OFF REPRESENTAT SOLOMON ISL,,"SHORTUS M, 2016, WEST PA SURVEILL RESPONSE","SHORTUS M, 2016, WEST PA SURVEILL RESPONSE",TRUE,0,0,0,0,0,3,8_15_16,1,1

The present paper discusses about flood and landslides which occurred due to cloud burst and heavy downpour in between 14 to 17 june, 2013 in the state. Uttarakhand is very susceptible to landslides and almost three fourth of the total geographical area of the state comes under sever to high landslide risk zone. The catastrophe started with cloud burst near rambara in rudraprayag district and due to torrential and continuous rainfall, almost all the major rivers and especially the mandakini and the alaknanda swelled up. Overflowing water reservoirs of the region catalysed the severity of the event. About one tenth of the upper catchment area of mandakini river swept away due to flood and landslide. This was the deadliest hazard in 80 years' history of the state which affected about 80,000 people. The paper reflects the nature's supremacy over human potentials and advocates the balanced man-nature relationship, especially in such terrains which are most fragile and critically balanced.

It was another of those one-in-every-1,000-year events that is occurring with frequency. There was also a brief tornado, but the flash floods throughout the state caused the major damage. In one county alone there were 15 deaths, and the victims included adults and young children who were swept away and drowned. Thousands lost homes, property, and jobs and many residents sought safety in the many shelters set up by the american red cross. Some residents who stayed in their homes were isolated and without power. They could not evacuate or get to shelters as dozens of roads were shut down or swept away and bridges across the state were damaged or destroyed. As the flooding receded and roads became passable, teams of red cross workers were deployed to assess the damage to homes, to pass out cleaning supplies, toiletries, meals, snacks, and water, and to offer mental health support. One team sat with a family in their home that was badly damaged. The parents reported to the dmh worker that they were more worried about their son than any of the property that was lost. Their eight-year-old was complaining about stomach aches and was not eating or sleeping as he had been before the storm. The mother said: ``it takes him an hour to get to sleep. He wants the light on and he wants one of us in there with him. The dmh worker suggested that the boy be examined by their pediatrician to check for any possible medical issues. She then asked a series of questions about their experience of the disaster, including: was any family member injured? Did they know anyone who died or was seriously injured? Could they tell her what the boy saw or heard during the storm? What did he and they lose? After about an hour of conversation the boy joined them and brought his pet turtle. He said that ``scooter was not hurt and was not afraid of the storm, as he was a good swimmer. The dmh worker then spoke with the parents alone. She explained that these were likely expected reactions to the devastating event that had just occurred and that the child's adjustment would probably coincide with home and school getting back to normal. She encouraged the parents to allow their son to talk about his feelings and that he would learn to deal with them. She also encouraged them to explain to him that he and they were safe (all of us, even scooter, are okay and will be okay). She emphasized the importance for them to reestablish routines as soon as possible. If things didn't get better over the next few weeks, she suggested they contact their pediatrician to see about getting more help for his stress.",,PSYCHOPATHOLOGY; DISASTERS,ENGLISH,"ARTICLE, BOOK CHAPTER",INCOLLECTION,0,"ADAMS ZW, 2014, J CHILD PSYCHOL PSYC, V55, P1047, DOI 10.1111/JCPP.12220.;ANNIE E.

These two types of natural hazards are closely related and are frequently triggered simultaneously by intense or prolonged rainfall at or near steep mountain fronts. As the global population has increased, economic losses and the loss of life have risen because of occupation and development of areas vulnerable to landslides and flash floods [1, 38]. Recent examples have been documented in the Campania region of Italy (1998), Acapulco, Mexico (1997); Honduras and Nicaragua (1998), eastern Mexican (1999), and northern Venezuela (1999).

331,Robinson D;Cruikshank K,"Hurricane hazel: disaster relief, politics, and society in canada, 1954-55",JOURNAL OF CANADIAN STUDIES-REVUE D ETUDES CANADIENNES,"On friday 16 october 1954, hurricane hazel generated flash floods in the watersheds surrounding toronto. Flooding destroyed bridges, engulfed trailer parks and residential areas, and swept automobiles, trailers, cottages and homes into the strong current. In this essay, the authors explore the ways that the federal and provincial governments interacted with voluntary organizations and local governments to deal with the immediate crisis produced by hazel's floods, and how they negotiated the lengthy process of restoration. The responses of those governments tell us much about the social and environmental assumptions as well as the political capacity of canadian society in the mid-1950s. The federal and provincial governments immediately promised action, but then reluctantly became involved in reconstruction, leaving as much responsibility as possible to voluntary organizations and local governments. A tropical storm travelling through the province of ontario was a relatively rare event, yet ultimately government officials did not respond to the hazel disaster as a random, chance event. Instead, the conservation movement and local authorities pressured governments to see the hurricane flooding not as a natural disaster, but as a tragedy, which human decisions had helped precipitate, and which, in the future, human decisions might alleviate.",,MANAGEMENT,ENGLISH,REVIEW,ARTICLE,5,"AHRRIS R, 1996, UNPLANNED SUBURBS.;[ANONYMOUS], 1954, GLOBE MAIL.;ASKEW A, 1991, NATURE RESOUR, V27, P4.;BAKER A, 1954, GLOBE MAIL 1029.;BARRY JOHN, 1997, RISING TIDE GREAT MI.;BOUCHIER NB, 2003, LABOUR-TRAVAIL, P9.;BRUCE JP, 1958, ESTABLISHMENT FLOOD.;BRYANT G, 1954, STAR 1018, P18.;BUMSTED JM, 1987, CAN HIST REV, V68, P347, DOI 10.3138/CHR-068-03-01.;BUMSTED JM, 1997, FLOODS CENTURIES HIS.;CAMPBELL N, 1954, COMMUNICATION 1103.;CAPLAN GERALD L., 1973, DILEMMA CANADIAN SOC.;CARSWELL JB, 1954, REPORT HURRICANE DAM.;CLAIRMONT DMJ, 1999, AFRICVILLE LIFE DEAT.;CLARK SD, 1966, SUBURBAN SOC.;COLTON TIMOTHY, 1980, BIG DADDY FG GARDINE.;*CONS AUTH BRANCH, 1958, FIL FLOOD WARN SYST.","ROBINSON, D (REPRINT AUTHOR), MCMASTER UNIV, HAMILTON, ON L8S 4L8, CANADA.;MCMASTER UNIV, HAMILTON, ON L8S 4L8, CANADA.",10.1353/JCS.2007.0011,"J CANADIAN STUDIES PO BOX 4800, PETERBOROUGH, ONTARIO K9J 7B8, CANADA",,,,0021-9495,1,37-70,TRENT UNIV,40,2006,ISI000238178800002,115,ARTS \& HUMANITIES - OTHER TOPICS,25,"HUMANITIES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY",,,051RQ,,"ROBINSON, D (REPRINT AUTHOR), MCMASTER UNIV, HAMILTON, ON L8S 4L8, CANADA",ISI,MCMASTER UNIV,MCMASTER UNIV,,"ROBINSON D, 2006, J CAN STUD -REV ETUD CAN","ROBINSON D, 2006, J CAN STUD -REV ETUD CAN",TRUE,0,4,0,3,2,0,8_16,1,2
323,Majewski W,Urban flash flood in gdansk - 2001. Case study,METEOROLOGY HYDROLOGY AND WATER MANAGEMENT-RESEARCH AND OPERATIONAL APPLICATIONS,"Gdansk is an important polish city and harbour situated on the southern coast of the baltic sea in the gulf of gdansk, in the lowland delta at the mouth of the vistula river. At present gdansk has 460 thousand inhabitants and covers an area of 262 km(2). The population and the area of the city have not changed over recent decades. In previous centuries the city was affected by severe floods, which caused considerable economic damage and the death of inhabitants. Most of these floods were caused by ice jams. The complicated system of rivers and channels within the city and in its close surroundings is called the gdansk water node (gwn). The possible directions of flood hazard are: from the sea (martwa vistula), and from the main vistula channel in the case of a breached left embankment. Flood hazard from the catchment of the rch was not considered by city authorities. In july 2001, a devastating flash flood unexpectedly hit the city of gdansk. The paper presents this flood as a case study, without reference to other floods of similar character. It describes the city of gdansk, which is an important economic, cultural, scientific, political and industrial center, the system of rivers and channels within gdansk which form gdansk water node (gwn), the precipitation regime, the course of the flood, and its effects. A special project was formulated after the flood with the aim of developing the proposal of new hydraulic engineering solutions in the gwn and in the catchment of radunia channel to prevent similar floods in the city in cases of rainfall similar to that of 2001. The paper also presents the implementation of the proposed engineering solutions.",GDANSK; URBAN FLASH FLOOD; RADUNIA CHANNEL; GDANSK WATER NODE; ENGINEERING PROPOSALS,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,5,"JASINSKA E., 2002, HYDROLOGY HYDRODYNAM.;JASINSKA E., 2004, P 37 DEFRA FLOOD COA, P1.;MAJEWSKI W., 2010, IMGW PI B.;MAJEWSKI W., 2004, MODEL WATER DI UNPUB.;MAJEWSKI W., 2002, P 2 ANN IIASA DPRI M, P29.;MAJEWSKI W., 2003, MODEL WATER DI UNPUB.;MAJEWSKI W., 2003, P C FLOOD GDANSK 200.;SZERMER B., 1971, GDANSK PRESENT.","MAJEWSKI, W (REPRINT AUTHOR), NATL RES INST, INST METEOROL \& WATER MANAGEMENT, PODLESNA 61, PL-01673 WARSAW, POLAND.;MAJEWSKI, WOJCIECH, NATL RES INST, INST METEOROL \& WATER MANAGEMENT, PODLESNA 61, PL-01673 WARSAW, POLAND.",10.26491/MHWM/64636,"PODLESNA 61, WARSAW, 01673, POLAND",,,,2299-3835,2,41-49,INST METEOROLOGY \& WATER MANAGEMENT,4,2016,ISI000407098000006,8,WATER RESOURCES,4,WATER RESOURCES,WMAJIBWPAN.GDA.PL,,FC8NM,,"MAJEWSKI, W (REPRINT AUTHOR), NATL RES INST, INST METEOROL \& WATER MANAGEMENT, PODLESNA 61, PL-01673 WARSAW, POLAND",ISI,NATL RES INST,NATL RES INST,,"MAJEWSKI W, 2016, METEOROL HYDROL WATER MANAG","MAJEWSKI W, 2016, METEOROL HYDROL WATER MANAG",TRUE,2,6,0,0,0,0,8_16,1,1
539,Duffaut P;Larouzee J,"Geology, engineering \& humanities: 3 sciences behind the malpasset dam failure (france, dec. 2, 1959)",QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY AND HYDROGEOLOGY,"On december 2, 1959, the malpasset arch dam in southeast france suddenly failed, flooding the valley down to the sea, causing huge destruction and more than 400 casualties. Built from 1952 to 1954 for water supply and irrigation, filling of the reservoir was delayed five years and the failure occurred following a flash flood of the river the dam was closing. Post failure studies and expertise during a trial revealed poor field investigations on a micaschist rock foundation crisscrossed by faults, and poor management of construction of the structure. The failure was ascribed to uplift, moving a rock dihedron defined by a conspicuous fault and a tear along foliation. This paper shows that, in addition to the many traps listed by previous investigations (mostly geological and geotechnical), the human and organizational factors can also shed a new light on this catastrophe. Keeping lessons from malpasset alive and increasing the knowledge about this case is relevant since worldwide, after the catastrophe, not only did new regulations on dams appear but also both fields of geological engineering and rock mechanics were developed. Thus, consciously or not, every geological engineer or rock mechanics specialists is somehow, a descendant of this case.",MALPASSET DAM FAILURE; CASE HISTORY; FIELD TESTS; HUMAN AND ORGANIZATIONAL FACTORS; LESSONS,,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,none,"LAROUZEE, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), PARIS UNIV, CTR RES RISKS \& CRISIS, PSL, MINES PARISTECH, PARIS, FRANCE.;LAROUZEE, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), 1 RUE CLAUDE DAUNESSE,BP 207, F-06904 SOPHIA ANTIPOLIS, FRANCE.;DUFFAUT, P., FRENCH COMM ROCK MECH, PARIS, FRANCE.;DUFFAUT, P., 81 BIS RUE VANEAU, F-75007 PARIS, FRANCE.;LAROUZEE, J., PARIS UNIV, CTR RES RISKS \& CRISIS, PSL, MINES PARISTECH, PARIS, FRANCE.;LAROUZEE, J., 1 RUE CLAUDE DAUNESSE,BP 207, F-06904 SOPHIA ANTIPOLIS, FRANCE.",10.1144/QJEGH2018-186,"UNIT 7, BRASSMILL ENTERPRISE CENTRE, BRASSMILL LANE, BATH BA1 3JN, AVON, ENGLAND",,,,1470-9236,4,445-458,GEOLOGICAL SOC PUBL HOUSE,52,2019,ISI000493939800006,36,"ENGINEERING, GEOLOGY",6,"ENGINEERING, GEOLOGICAL, GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY",PIERRE.DUFFAUTGMAIL.COM JUSTIN.LAROUZEEMINES-PARISTECH.FR,,JJ1RU,,"LAROUZEE, J (REPRINT AUTHOR), PARIS UNIV, CTR RES RISKS \& CRISIS, PSL, MINES PARISTECH, PARIS, FRANCE",ISI,PARIS UNIV,PARIS UNIV,,"DUFFAUT P, 2019, Q J ENG GEOL HYDROGEOL","DUFFAUT P, 2019, Q J ENG GEOL HYDROGEOL",TRUE,0,6,0,0,0,1_6,8_16,0,3
122,Rosenzweig Br;Mcphillips L;Chang H;Cheng C;Welty C;Matsler M;Iwaniec D;Davidson Ci,Pluvial flood risk and opportunities for resilience,WILEY INTERDISCIPLINARY REVIEWS-WATER,"The risk presented by pluvial flooding has emerged as a critical issue in urban water management. Pluvial flooding occurs when precipitation intensity exceeds the capacity of natural and engineered drainage systems, and it is expected to increase in frequency, severity and impact through the 21st century due to the combined effects of climate change and urbanization. Although there have been recent advances in approaches to assess the risk presented pluvial flooding and to enhance the resilience of cities to its impacts, they have not been broadly implemented and there are many opportunities for additional research. We provide case studies of pluvial flooding in six cities in the continental united states, which serve as examples of the current vulnerability of cities that have not developed comprehensive pluvial flood management plans and the challenges in conducting pluvial flood research in light of existing data gaps. We also identify key research challenges that should be prioritized by the interdisciplinary water research community to better support urban resilience practice.

69,Petrucci O;Pasqua Aa,Damaging events along roads during bad weather periods: a case study in calabria (italy),NATURAL HAZARDS AND EARTH SYSTEM SCIENCES,"The study focuses on circumstances that affect people during periods of bad weather conditions characterised by winds, rainfall, landslides, flooding, and storm surges. A methodological approach and its application to a study area in southern italy are presented here. A 10-yr database was generated by mining data from a newspaper. Damaging agents were sorted into five types: flood, urban flooding, landslide, wind, and storm surge. Damage to people occurred in 126 cases, causing 13 victims, 129 injured and about 782 people involved but not injured. For cases of floods, urban flooding and landslides, the analysis does not highlight straightforward relationships between rainfall and damage to people, even if the events showed different features according to the months of occurrence. The events occurring between may and october were characterised by concentrated and intense rainfall, and between may and july, the highest values of hourly (103 mm on the average) and monthly rainfall (114 mm on the average) were recorded. Urban flooding and flash floods were the most common damaging agents: injured, involved people and more rarely, cases with victims were reported. Between november and april, the highest number of events was recorded. Rainfall presented longer durations and hourly and sub-hourly rainfall were lower than those recorded between may and october. Landslides were the most frequent damaging agents but the highest number of cases with victims, which occurred between november and january, were mainly related to floods and urban flooding. Motorists represent the totality of the victims, 84\% of the people were injured and the whole of people involved. All victims were men, and the average age was 43 yr. The primary cause of death was drowning caused by floods, and the second was trauma suffered in car accidents caused by urban flooding. The high number of motorists rescued in sub-merged cars reveals an underestimation of danger in the case of floods, often increased by the sense of security related to the familiarity of the road. In contrast, in the cases of people involved in landslides, when there was enough time to realise the potential risk, people behaved appropriately to avoid negative consequences. Of the victims, 50\% were killed along fast-flowing roads, this may be related to the high speed limit in force on these roads, as a car's speed reduces the reaction time of a driver's response to an unexpected situation, whatever the damaging agent is. These results can be used in local information/education campaigns to both increase risk awareness and promote self-protective behaviours. Moreover, the mapping of damaging effects pointed out the regional sectors in which the high frequency of the events suggests further planning of in-depth examinations, which can individuate the critical points and local regulator interventions that might change damage incidences in the future.",,FLOOD FATALITIES; UNITED-STATES; LANDSLIDE RISK; AUSTRALIA; HAZARDS; NORTH; SPAIN; LIFE,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,16,"ADHIKARI P, 2010, NAT HAZARDS, V55, P405, DOI 10.1007/S11069-010-9537-2.;AGASSE E, 2003, PALAEOFLOODS HIST FL, P99.;ASHLEY ST, 2008, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V47, P805, DOI 10.1175/2007JAMC1611.1.;ASHLEY WS, 2008, J APPL METEOROL CLIM, V47, P717, DOI 10.1175/2007JAMC1689.1.;BARNIKEL F, 2003, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V3, P625, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-3-625-2003.;BLONG R, 2003, NAT HAZARDS, V29, P57, DOI 10.1023/A:1022960414329.;BOHOLM M, 2009, RISK ANAL, V29, P1566, DOI 10.1111/J.1539-6924.2009.01296.X.;BUDETTA P, 2002, B ENG GEOL ENVIRON, V61, P293, DOI DOI 10.1007/S10064-002-0161-6.;COATES L, 1999, AUST GEOGR, V30, P391, DOI 10.1080/00049189993657.;COPIEN C, 2008, NAT HAZARDS, V45, P173, DOI 10.1007/S11069-007-9166-6.;CROZIER MJ, 2005, LANDSLIDES, V2, P247, DOI 10.1007/S10346-005-0019-7.;CUESTA MJD, 1999, GEOMORPHOLOGY, V30, P125.;DEVOLI G, 2007, LANDSLIDES, V4, P5, DOI 10.1007/S10346-006-0048-X.;DROBOT S.

484,Sen R;Chakrabarti S,Disaster management dynamics - an analysis of chaos from the flash flood (2013) in the fragile himalayan system,JOURNAL OF THE GEOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF INDIA,"Managing a disaster is a very complex issue in which both the people and the affected region of the particular country are involved. In disasters, the vision of reality entails proper understanding of complexity, uncertainty and instability in the backdrop of nonlinear dynamics. Decision making in case of disasters is a nonlinear thread which has to wind its way through various rhythms and systems that range from ground reality to management operations. The uttarakhand disaster of 2013 is not a simple straight line extension of a house fire or an automobile accident. It is a mixed web of complexity, nonlinearity, instability and chaos. Maintaining hierarchy in decision making and managing a disaster of such magnitude in public domain has been found to be ineffective in operations. The theory of chaos and the science of complexity can lead to better disaster management options. In fact, chaos theory provides viable framework for management of natural disasters. Chaos theory describes how the human society influences the reality. Indeed, in some degrees, the society relevant for the region creates it. In the indian himalayas in uttarakhand state, during the third week of june 2013, intermittent and unprecedented precipitation covering large area led to flash floods and landslides. They carried away everything resulting in colossal loss of life and property. Incoherencies in management occurred mainly because of lack of understanding of nonlinear dynamics and deterministic chaos in natural phenomena and a fixed approach i.e. `mode lock-in' approach in decision making. In this article, the disaster situation is established to have been initiated due to forces of deterministic chaos. On this basis, some suggestions are formulated where help of the chaos theory may prove congenial to decision making.",,KOLMOGOROV-ENTROPY; KEDARNATH; NEPAL; RISK,ENGLISH,ARTICLE,ARTICLE,1,none,"CHAKRABARTI, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), SISTER NIBEDITA GOVT COLL, DEPT GEOL, KOLKATA, INDIA.;CHAKRABARTI, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), GOVT WEST BENGAL, DEPT HIGHER EDUC SCI \& TECHNOL \& BIOTECHNOL, KOLKATA, INDIA.;SEN, RANEN, COLORADO SCH MINES, GOLDEN, CO 80401 USA.;CHAKRABARTI, SHARADINDRA, SISTER NIBEDITA GOVT COLL, DEPT GEOL, KOLKATA, INDIA.;CHAKRABARTI, SHARADINDRA, GOVT WEST BENGAL, DEPT HIGHER EDUC SCI \& TECHNOL \& BIOTECHNOL, KOLKATA, INDIA.",10.1007/S12594-019-1180-2,"7TH FLOOR, VIJAYA BUILDING, 17, BARAKHAMBA ROAD, NEW DELHI, 110 001, INDIA",,,,0016-7622,3,321-330,SPRINGER INDIA,93,2019,ISI000460955400010,54,GEOLOGY,3,"GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY",SHARAD\_PRESIREDIFFMAIL.COM,,HO5HL,,"CHAKRABARTI, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), SISTER NIBEDITA GOVT COLL, DEPT GEOL, KOLKATA, INDIA",ISI,COLORADO SCH MINES;SISTER NIBEDITA GOVT COLL;DEPT HIGHER EDUC SCI AND TECHNOL AND BIOTECHNOL,SISTER NIBEDITA GOVT COLL,,"SEN R, 2019, J GEOL SOC INDIA","SEN R, 2019, J GEOL SOC INDIA",TRUE,0,6,0,0,0,1_6,9_11_16,0,5

Since the 1990s, however, numerous events have shown that these measures are not always effective. As a result, institutions now consider that other actions, such as preventive measures, are possible. Risk management is based on public policies and involves a number of players, as well as the societies exposed to the risks. The goal of our study is to show the various orientations of risk management by looking at several examples from mediterranean france, where flash floods are common, in particular using post event analysis. Post-event observations let us evaluate the effectiveness of flood-management methods. Do public policies work, and do they have a real influence on reducing deaths and damage? Are individual measures overtaking collective ones? The main results of our study show that the event itself is more important in determining which measures are applied than public policies, which do not take into account local specificities.",,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,"BARTHELEMY F., 2006, 25054 IGE.;CAUMONT V., 2012, RISQUE SUBMERSION MA.;DEFOSSEZ S., 2009, THESIS.;DELEAU M, 1986, EVALUER POLITIQUES P.;DOUVINET J, 2011, ESPACE GEOGRAPHIQUE, V40, P31, DOI DOI 10.3917/EG.401.0031.;DRUON E., 2015, GESTION CRISE VULNER, P98.;HEAUME C, 2015, EVOLUTION PERCEPTION.;LAGAHE E., 2014, EVALUATION VULNERABI.;LEONE F., 2007, GEOCARREFOUR, V82, P77.;MADORE, 2004, ANN RECHERCHE URBAIN, P99.;POTTIER N., 1998, THESIS.;REY T., 2014, VERTIGO IN PRESS.;VEYRET Y, 2013, ATLAS RISQUES FRANCE.;VINET F., 2011, VERTIGO REV ELECT SC, V11.","DEFOSSEZ, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), UMR GOUVERNANCE RISQUES ENVIRONM DEV UPVM IRD, 2196 BD LIRONDE,BAT 4, F-34980 MONTFERRIER SUR LEZ, FRANCE.;DEFOSSEZ, STEPHANIE, REY, TONY, VINET, FREDDY, BOISSIER, LAURENT, UMR GOUVERNANCE RISQUES ENVIRONM DEV UPVM IRD, 2196 BD LIRONDE,BAT 4, F-34980 MONTFERRIER SUR LEZ, FRANCE.",10.1051/E3SCONF/20160720019,"17 AVE DU HOGGAR PARC D ACTIVITES COUTABOEUF BP 112, F-91944 CEDEX A, FRANCE","LANG, M AND KLIJN, F AND SAMUELS, P",,,2267-1242,,,E D P SCIENCES,7,2016,ISI000392270100234,14,"ENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES \& ECOLOGY, GEOLOGY, PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION, WATER RESOURCES",6,"ENGINEERING, ENVIRONMENTAL, ENGINEERING, CIVIL, ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCES, GEOSCIENCES, MULTIDISCIPLINARY, REGIONAL \& URBAN PLANNING, WATER RESOURCES",STEPHANIE.DEFOSSEZUNIV-MONTP3.FR,E3S WEB OF CONFERENCES,BG8GU,3RD EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT (FLOODRISK 2016),"DEFOSSEZ, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), UMR GOUVERNANCE RISQUES ENVIRONM DEV UPVM IRD, 2196 BD LIRONDE,BAT 4, F-34980 MONTFERRIER SUR LEZ, FRANCE",ISI,UMR GOUVERNANCE RISQUES ENVIRONM DEV UPVM IRD,UMR GOUVERNANCE RISQUES ENVIRONM DEV UPVM IRD,,"DEFOSSEZ S, 2016, 3RD EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT (FLOODRISK 2016)","DEFOSSEZ S, 2016, 3RD EUROPEAN CONFERENCE ON FLOOD RISK MANAGEMENT (FLOODRISK 2016)",FALSE,1,4_6,0,0,0,1_6,9_13,0,1

233,Atta-Ur-Rahman Ar;Farzana F;Rahman G;Shaw R,"Flood disasters and land use planning in swat valley, eastern hindu kush",LAND USE MANAGEMENT IN DISASTER RISK REDUCTION: PRACTICE AND CASES FROM A GLOBAL PERSPECTIVE,"This chapter analyzes the flood disasters and effectiveness of land use planning and enforcement in swat valley, eastern hindu kush, north pakistan. In swat valley, flooding is a recurrently occurring phenomenon. In upper reaches flash flood characteristics dominate, while downstream madyan river flooding dominates the scene. Downstream madyan, swat river enters into a wide basin and braided into numerous channels. The meandering river is frequently changing its course. In swat valley, almost every year in summer, the peak discharge overflows the natural levees and in effect causes damages to scarce agricultural land, housing, and other sectors. While in certain areas, deep riverbank erosion is very active and engulfing the farmland and built-up areas. Primarily, the active floodplain of swat river was a vast grazing land, but with passage of time, the increasing population has used it for cultivation and other developments without taking into consideration risk of floods. This in turn has enhanced the flood vulnerability to various developments. For centuries people lived within the valley of swat river with the reality of flooding as a natural hazard and with the fact that it has a potential to cause damages to people and their belongings, but so for no attention has been given to land use regulation and zoning. Land use regulations have been widely used as a non-structural flood mitigation strategy in reducing exposure of people and their property. It was found from the analysis that frequent human encroachments onto the flood channel and absence of land use regulations have been identified as the major factors responsible for heavy flood losses. Looking into potential and challenges in land use planning, this is high time to undertake fluvial morphology and rainfall-runoff model for flood risk assessment and spatial land use planning.",SWAT VALLEY; LAND USE; FLOOD; DAMAGES; REGULATION AND ENFORCEMENT,PAKISTAN; MANAGEMENT; AREAS,ENGLISH,"ARTICLE, BOOK CHAPTER",INCOLLECTION,0,"ALI U, 1985, THESIS U PESHAWAR PA.;[ANONYMOUS], 2011, NATL PROGR REPORT IM.;APFM - ASSOCIATED PROGRAMME ON FLOOD MANAGEMENT, 2007, GUID FLASH FLOOD MAN.;ATTA-UR-RAHMAN, 2015, DISAST RISK REDUCT, P295, DOI 10.1007/978-4-431-55369-4\_16.;ATTA-UR-RAHMAN, 2013, NAT HAZARDS, V66, P887, DOI 10.1007/S11069-012-0528-3.;ATTA-UR-RAHMAN, 2011, NAT HAZARDS, V59, P1239, DOI 10.1007/S11069-011-9830-8.;BALAMIR M, 2013, OBSTACLES ADOPTION I, P2.;CARTER NT, 2005, FLOOD RISK MANAGEMEN, V12.;DI MARTIRE D, 2012, NAT HAZARD EARTH SYS, V12, P905, DOI 10.5194/NHESS-12-905-2012.;GOP, 2012, NAT DIS MAN PLAN 201.;GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN (GOA), 2013, AFGH HFA NAT PROGR R, P25.;HAEUSLER T., 2000, PROVINCIAL FOREST RE.;KHAN F., 2003, GEOGRAPHY PAKISTAN P.;KHAN SR, 2009, ECOL ECON, V68, P2607, DOI 10.1016/J.ECOLECON.2009.04.018.;KRON A, 2007, ADV URBAN FLOOD MANA, P213.;QAMER FM, 2012, J MT SCI-ENGL, V9, P297, DOI 10.1007/S11629-009-2319-1.;QASIM M, 2011, APPL GEOGR, V31, P820, DOI 10.1016/J.APGEOG.2010.08.008.;RAHMAN A, 2016, CLIM DYNAM, P1.;RAHMAN A, 2014, MOUNTAIN HAZARDS DIS, P33.;ROME S, 2005, FORESTRY PRINCELY ST.;TARIQ MAUR, 2012, PHYS CHEM EARTH, V47-48, P11, DOI 10.1016/J.PCE.2011.08.014.;UNISDR ASIA AND PACIFIC, 2012, YOG DECL DIS RISK RE.;YUSUF A.

The disaster caused a black-out, leading to a serious network failure which delayed rescue work in isolated areas. The lack of robust communication network has become a sizable topic for scrutiny of disaster inflicted area network system. Thus, it is important to design a network which never fails during such crisis. In this paper, a detailed survey of aons (always-on network) is done and issues in implementation of those are highlighted.

573,Phan Nk;Sherchan Sp,Microbiological assessment of tap water following the 2016 louisiana flooding,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,"Floods are a prominent risk factor in the world of public health, as there is a risk of dispersal of harmful biological and chemical contaminants in floodwater. As climate change increases, the occurrence of natural disasters and risk of adverse health outcomes due to flash flooding also increases. Fecal indicator bacteria, such as escherichia coli and enterococci, are often encountered in contaminated floodwater and can cause gastrointestinal illnesses as well as a variety of infections. In august 2016, east baton rouge and surrounding parishes in louisiana suffered heavy floods due to intense rainfall. No study of water quality during flooding has been conducted previously in baton rouge, louisiana. Twenty-three pre-flush and post-flush water samples were collected immediately from accessible homes that had been affected by the floods in order to quantify concentrations of fecal indicator bacteria. These samples were analyzed for the presence of e. Coli and enterococci through both quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qpcr) and the idexx enzyme substrate method. The qpcr results indicated that 30\% of the samples contained enterococci and 61\% of the samples contained e. Coli, with the highest concentrations found in the pre-flush outdoor hose and the pre-flush kitchen tap. The idexx method yielded total coliforms in 65\% of the samples, e. Coli in 4\%, and enterococci in 35\%, with the highest concentrations in the pre-flush outdoor faucet and the pre-flush post-filtration kitchen tap. Physical parameters including temperature, barometer pressure, dissolved oxygen, oxidation reduction potential, ph, conductivity, and salinity of these samples were also recorded. Of these parameters, conductivity and salinity were significant, suggesting they may positively influence e. Coli and enterococci growth.",FLOODWATER; FECAL CONTAMINATION; E.

It is located in the foothills of the himalaya and shows wide variation in lithology and topography. Pasighat census town, established in the year 1911, is the headquarter of the district which falls in zone iii of the seismic hazard zonation map of north-eastern region of india, and can experience peak ground acceleration of the order of 200-250 cm/s(2). Flash floods, landslide dam outburst floods (ldofs) are the major geohazards in the district that causes heavy destruction of life and property. Other geohazards include landslides, hailstorm and forest fire spread across the year. The ldof in tibet on 11 june 2000 caused death of many people living in the downstream areas of the east siang district. It also affected more than 10,000 people, submergence of villages and standing crops, and collapse of bridges in arunachal pradesh and assam. The occurrences of flash floods have risen in the past decade causing partial damage to the township of pasighat. A large numbers of rural link roads, culverts, suspension bridges and wooden bridges have been collapsed due to landslides, flash floods and ldof time to time. In view of the fact that, siang is trans-boundary river, temporal coverage in real time and at frequent intervals is ` thus' required for continuous monitoring of behavior of the river in relation to incessant rains, cloudbursts and on-going neotectonic activity. A geoethical approach is needed in establishment of integrated flood mitigation strategies by effectively using adequate technologies and sharing of scientific knowledge at trans-boundary levels.",GEOHAZARDS; EAST SIANG DISTRICT; SIANG RIVER; GEOETHICS; INTEGRATED FLOOD MITIGATION STRATEGIES,PASIGHAT,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,"LUIREI K, 2008, J GEOL SOC INDIA, V71, P502.;MASKREY A., 1989, DISASTER MITIGATION, P100.;MOHAN K, 2008, J INDIAN GEOPHYS UNI, V12, P97.;PEPPOLONI S, 2012, ANN GEOPHYS, V55, P3.;TEWARI P, 2004, NAT HAZARDS, V32, P257, DOI 10.1023/B:NHAZ.0000031317.69865.B7.","ACHARJEE, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), ARUNACHAL PRADESH STATE COUNCIL SCI \& TECHNOL, ESS SECT, DEPT SCI \& TECHNOL, STATE REMOTE SENSING APPLICAT CTR, ITANAGAR 791111, INDIA.;ARUNACHAL PRADESH STATE COUNCIL SCI \& TECHNOL, ESS SECT, DEPT SCI \& TECHNOL, STATE REMOTE SENSING APPLICAT CTR, ITANAGAR 791111, INDIA.",10.1007/978-3-319-09303-1\_27,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND","LOLLINO, G AND ARATTANO, M AND GIARDINO, M AND OLIVEIRA, R AND PEPPOLONI, S",,"978-3-319-09303-1, 978-3-319-09302-4",,,141-143,SPRINGER INT PUBLISHING AG,,2014,ISI000358981400027,5,ENGINEERING,3,"ENGINEERING, GEOLOGICAL",SWAPNA\_AYAHOO.COM,,BD2OG,"ENGINEERING GEOLOGY FOR SOCIETY AND TERRITORY, VOL 7: EDUCATION, PROFESSIONAL ETHICS AND PUBLIC RECOGNITION OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY","ACHARJEE, S (REPRINT AUTHOR), ARUNACHAL PRADESH STATE COUNCIL SCI \& TECHNOL, ESS SECT, DEPT SCI \& TECHNOL, STATE REMOTE SENSING APPLICAT CTR, ITANAGAR 791111, INDIA",ISI,STATE REMOTE SENSING APPLICAT CTR,STATE REMOTE SENSING APPLICAT CTR,,"ACHARJEE S, 2014, ENGINEERING GEOLOGY FOR SOCIETY AND TERRITORY, VOL 7: EDUCATION, PROFESSIONAL ETHICS AND PUBLIC RECOGNITION OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY","ACHARJEE S, 2014, ENGINEERING GEOLOGY FOR SOCIETY AND TERRITORY, VOL 7: EDUCATION, PROFESSIONAL ETHICS AND PUBLIC RECOGNITION OF ENGINEERING GEOLOGY",TRUE,0,4,0,0,1,1_2_6,9_16,2,3_5
439,Zeitler Jw,A new flash flood action paradigm,21ST CONFERENCE ON SEVERE LOCAL STORMS,"Tropical Storm Allison struck Southeast Texas from June 5-10, 2002. Twenty-two people lost their lives, damage totaled over $5 billion, and nearly 50,000 homes were flooded. Despite accurate forecasts, extensive pre-event awareness outreach, and continuous media coverage, many were still surprised by the intensity of rainfall and flooding. This event clearly demonstrates that decades of flash flood awareness have yet to be fully effective in preventing loss of life and mitigating the financial and emotional impact of flash flooding. Increasing urbanization and population in coastal and southwestern states indicates that a new type of flood -- the urban area flood -- is becoming the major life and property threat for metropolitan areas.

A new flash flood action paradigm and education campaign has been developed to address the growing threat from urban area floods. The key paradigm idea is that most of the financial, emotional, and loss of life risks from floods can be eliminated or significantly mitigated well beforehand. The key to the education campaign is rooted in action. The education campaign provides five simple actions that individuals can take to meet the paradigm of minimal flood risk.",,,ENGLISH,PROCEEDINGS PAPER,INPROCEEDINGS,0,"*FEMA, 2001, NAT FLOOD INS PROGR.","ZEITLER, JW (REPRINT AUTHOR), NOAA, NWS WEATHER FORECAST OFF, AUSTIN, TX USA.;NOAA, NWS WEATHER FORECAST OFF, AUSTIN, TX USA.",,"45 BEACON ST, BOSTON, MA 02108 USA",,,,,,236-238,AMER METEOROLOGICAL SOCIETY,,2002,ISI000185646400063,4,"METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, REMOTE SENSING, IMAGING SCIENCE \& PHOTOGRAPHIC TECHNOLOGY",0,"METEOROLOGY \& ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCES, REMOTE SENSING, IMAGING SCIENCE \& PHOTOGRAPHIC TECHNOLOGY",,,BX54R,21ST CONFERENCE ON SEVERE LOCAL STORMS,"ZEITLER, JW (REPRINT AUTHOR), NOAA, NWS WEATHER FORECAST OFF, AUSTIN, TX USA",ISI,,NOTREPORTED,,"ZEITLER JW, 2002, 21ST CONFERENCE ON SEVERE LOCAL STORMS","ZEITLER JW, 2002, 21ST CONFERENCE ON SEVERE LOCAL STORMS",FALSE,1,4,0,0,0,2_3_4,9_16,1,2
